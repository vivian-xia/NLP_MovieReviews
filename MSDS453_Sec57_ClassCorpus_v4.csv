0,HAG_Doc1_Frozen2,"Parents, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Frozen 2s new showstopper Into the Unknown isnt as aggressive an earworm as Let it Go. Its more lyrically complex, with a lot more high notes  the kind thatll break your eardrums if sung by anyone who isnt Idina Menzel  and its hard to imagine a car full of kids howling such a delicate scale for hours upon hours.
Frozen 2, Disneys sequel to its $1.3bn hit, is more mature, ambitious, and intricate than its predecessor. That doesnt automatically make it better  Frozens success was built on a simple and relatable story of sisterly love  but its different enough not to feel like a stale rerun. There are surprises here to uncover, and a renewed sense of energy to the proceedings. Admittedly, the film does play with fire by taking the same path as other sequels, padding out a characters backstory in the hope itll add depth to their world. There are echoes of last months Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, as Queen Elsa (Menzel) is carted off to a magical place that might provide a few answers about where she comes from. But Frozen 2 succeeds where so many others have failed.
As the sentient snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) himself neatly summarises in one scene, Elsa made peace with her ice powers at the end of Frozen, when she discovered that the key to it all was love. Now, she rules over Arendelle, while Anna (Kristen Bell) and her boyfriend Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) provide a sense of domestic normalcy through weekly charade sessions.
That is, until a mysterious female voice (provided by Norwegian singer Aurora) pierces the quiet and shakes Elsas soul. Is someone out there looking for her? Does she have a greater purpose beyond the castle walls? Anyone hoping Disney is finally giving Elsa a girlfriend, by the way, will be sorely disappointed  her sexuality still remains purposefully obscure.
Instead, this alluring call draws Elsa into an enchanted forest that feels ripped straight from the pages of Norwegian mythology. There are giants, runes, and an indigenous tribe inspired by the Smi people. Frozen 2 has an authenticity that immediately separates it from so many other subpar follow-ups. Its worldbuilding not only feels earned, but meaningful. Returning directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck ensure that every frame is exquisitely detailed and rich with colour: we move gracefully from autumn leaves to the pinkish glow of ethereal fire, then on to stormy, grey waves and shimmering ice crystals.
Certain sequences here are even more spectacular than the creation of Elsas ice castle, with the filmmakers now more confident to step out of reality and deliver something truly jaw-dropping. Lees screenplay, too, makes some bold choices. She teases out several compelling ideas: environmentalism, reparations, exploitation and how we should confront the past. Its all vague enough that it could be applied to a hundred different real-world situations, which perhaps makes it all the more powerful as a learning tool for families.
But Frozen 2 doesnt lose itself in rootless ambition. It works because were guided through these strange, unfamiliar surroundings by the steady hands of Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf  characters with whom were all very much familiar (or, for some parents, exhaustingly familiar)  and the cast sink straight back into their roles.",HAG_Doc1_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Positive,Frozen_2
1,HAG_Doc2_Frozen2,"Theyre back  the first Disney princesses to persuade the box-office that they dont need a handsome prince to extract them from trouble.
Instead, they rely on sisterly love and co-operation, and its working. Frozen II is already shaping up as the most lucrative animated movie ever made.
It opens as Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is settling into her routine as queen of Arendelle, her Nordic realm precariously perched on the edge of a fjord. She is satisfied that she has learnt to control the magical gift that has endowed her with the powers of a human ice-making machine and life is looking good. But something is bothering her. The neighbouring forest is enchanted which, in this case, is bad news for its been turned into a no-go zone by a blinding mist so thick that its indigenous residents, the Northuldra, cant get out and everybody else is barred from getting in. Its a stalemate and Elsa is beginning to believe that she can bring it to an end.
The film is directed by the same team who did the original and once again, they have arrived at a judicious mixture of old and new. The action is punctuated with enough songs to fill an MGM musical and although the animation is computer-generated in 3D, its style owes a lot to the glory days of the studios hand-drawn animation era and its traditional Disney princesses with their wide eyes and doll-like faces. The script, however, is scrupulously up-to-date with great attention paid to the films feminist credentials and cultural correctness. After the writers decided to tap into Nordic folklore, Scandinavias Sami communities were consulted and the background artists, were told, were equally scrupulous, composing a landscape without a plant out of place.
It turns out that the forest has gone into lockdown because of environmental damage sustained years earlier. Naturally, human beings were responsible and Elsa and her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell) suspect that the secret is buried in their own familys history. But they can discover the truth only by risking a trip into the forest.
The expedition takes a while to get underway. First, their intentions and fears have to be spelled out in song and their escorts  Olaf, the warm-hearted snowman (Josh Gad), Annas suitor Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer, Sven  have to be briefed.
And when they get there and set about putting things to rights, the script isnt exactly adroit in dreaming up obstacles to impede their progress. Its contrivances are decidedly creaky, the aim being to separate the group of friends so that they become small islands of desperation, each convinced that the others have left them to fend for themselves. The exception is Elsa, who charges off on her own quest, fighting fire, flood and cyclone by shooting out mini-ice floes at every turn. Its impressive enough to suggest that she should be called upon to help in quenching the Californian or our own  bushfires.
Anna and Kristoff lose one another amid the mayhem but she, at least, has Olaf to provide comic relief, which becomes essential when they become trapped in a maze-like cavern deep in the forests forbidding basalt escarpment. The Arendelle scenes are a study in autumnal colours but once we reach the forest, the films palette takes a sudden turn to the dark and wintry.
The climax gives both sisters the chance to be heroes but the most spectacular bits belong to Elsa and her encounters with the Dark Sea, home of the Nokk  an equine water spiritwho doesnt exactly welcome her into his domain. These sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous.
The film itself doesnt hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children. Its pace is uneven and in the early scenes, the songs slow down the action so much that the younger kids at my screening were getting restless. But judging from those US box-office figures, theres more than enough here to build on the goodwill generated by the original and create a besotted new audience.",HAG_Doc2_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Positive,Frozen_2
2,HAG_Doc3_Frozen2,"Released in 2013 to a record-scorching $1.29 billion, Frozen was such a huge hit for Walt Disney Animation Studios that many of its fans were probably assuming its sequel would play it safe and deliver more of the same: a sparkling 21st-century fairy tale in which a pair of wide-eyed heroines shrug off the need to be rescued by men, demonstrating the power of self-reliance and sisterly love. Certainly, screenwriter Jennifer Lee (who once again co-directs with Chris Buck) would be foolish to stray too far from this formula, but Frozen II is anything but a mindless remake.
Ironically, Frozen fans may secretly be wishing for a more straightforward rehash, and to them, the best advice comes in the form of three little words: Let it go  a mantra theyve surely internalized since the first movie. As with snowflakes, no two are alike, and this gorgeous, glittering reunion of siblings Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) proudly flaunts its own identity, even while taking care to incorporate so much of what worked about the original  like a steady stream of wisecracks from wonderstruck snowperson Olaf (Josh Gad).
In myriad ways, Frozen II feels more like a follow-up to Pixars Brave than it does an extension of Disneys earlier (very loose) adaptation of Hans Christian Andersens The Snow Queen. Gone is the need for a conventional villain; gone are any expectations of princes charming or otherwise; gone are the gowns that have shaped young womens dreams of prom and wedding attire for more than a century. Frozen II pushes the girl-power themes even further, rejecting dresses in favor of pants for much of the adventure, as Anna and Elsa set out to find the source of a mysterious song emanating from somewhere far to the north  a mythical place called Ahtohallan that holds the secret of their parents disappearance, as well as the key to finding peace with nature and the Northuldra, an indigenous tribe toward whom theyve been taught to be wary.
Frozen II isnt obnoxious about its revisionist point of view  progressive vis--vis the Disney values of past decades  though its hardly subtle about its millennial-minded politics either. The film opens with a bedtime-story version of the kingdoms past  as recounted by the royal sisters parents, king Agnarr (Alfred Molina) and queen Iduna (Evan Rachel Wood) of Arendelle  in which their grandfather (Jeremy Sisto) and head general Mattias (Sterling K. Brown) are portrayed as the victims of a magical attack that resulted in an enchanted forest being wrapped in mist for more than 34 years. This prologue ends with the revelation (too obvious to be considered a spoiler) that Granddad was actually a conniving colonialist, and that everything bad that has happened to the family was a direct result of his misguided attempts to manipulate others.
Such themes surely resonate with todays younger audiences, who, when confronted with issues such as racial inequity and climate change, are being forced to reckon with the sins and shortcomings of previous generations. The words of environmental activist Greta Thunbergs recent speech echo in Anna and Elsas actions: You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.
Conventional Disney princess movies  in which alabaster beauties from Snow White to Belle passively awaited the liberating effects of true loves kiss  may have been taken at face value for most of the studios history, but todays kids have gotten savvy. They recognize the often-problematic socializing effects of popular entertainment, and they demand better. They also know when theyre being patronized, and at times, Frozen II tiptoes a bit too carefully along that fine line, where escapism stops being fun because the adults responsible have started overthinking the politics of it all.
The first half-hour smacks of calculation, as the movie finds ways to message to audiences where it stands in relation to the original, rather than intuitively picking up where that installment left off, the way the Toy Story and How to Train Your Dragon sequels so gracefully did. In a way, songwriting couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez set this challenge for themselves by creating such a memorable Broadway-style soundtrack for the first movie, and here, the first couple songs (including the forgettable All Is Found) feel second best.
Its not until Menzel sings Into the Unknown that Frozen II comes anywhere near the goose-bump-inducing, icicles-on-the-nape-of-your-neck thrill audiences experienced with Let It Go last time around  although none of this cartoons new tunes packs quite that punch. Even so, the characters spend an awful lot of time singing: Groff delivers the amusingly over-earnest pop-idol parody Lost in the Woods, and later, Bell belts out goody-goody anthem The Next Right Thing. (All three of those songs are repeated in less-interesting Radio Disney-ready cover versions over the marathon end-credits roll, performed by the likes of Panic! at the Disco, Kacey Musgraves and Weezer.)
In a Broadway show, the musical numbers reveal feelings the characters wouldnt dare speak aloud, although the most effective I want song here comes from none other than Olaf, who yearns to understand the world better When I Am Older. All four characters alternate articulating where their minds are at the opening via the song Some Things Never Change, and though the sequence features stunning animation, its presence stalls the proceedings. Whereas the prologue informs that the fighting enraged the spirits, and they turned against us  language clearly engineered to misdirect  its not until nearly an hour later, when the trolls explain, The past is not what it seems.  The truth must be found, that the story finally finds its proper course.
Reunited by their last adventure, the sisters are now closer than ever. Though Elsa has been named queen, she privately wrestles with the feeling that she doesnt belong in Arendelle. Shes been gifted with magical abilities  namely, the blessing/curse of blasting snow and ice from her fingertips  and yet, the first movie never explained how or why she came by these talents, while Anna lacks them altogether. Frozen II gives Elsa a chance to get to the bottom of the mystery while showing audiences that its OK for people to feel restless when their potential is being constrained. Normally, a character in Elsas position would wander off on her own in search of answers, but her connection with Anna is too strong for that, and her sister insists on coming along. As Anna tells her at one point, You dont want me to follow you into fire? Then dont run into fire!
Clearly, familial love still takes precedence over the romantic kind this time around. While Anna focuses on accompanying Elsa to the enchanted forest, her would-be suitor Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) is trying to psych himself into proposing marriage, but every time he opens his mouth in Annas company, he winds up choking on his own foot instead. The movie isnt necessarily against matrimony, but it doesnt want girls to think its the secret to living happily ever after either, offering a variation on the way fairy tales and Jane Austen novels have sold the institution to female audiences in the past.
Confiding in his ever-reliable reindeer Sven, Kristoff struggles with showing Anna his true feelings for most of the movie, before at last making himself useful with the words Im here. What do you need? How wonderful it would be to see that simple phrase adopted by the problem-solving men of Western society  it may well be the most welcome lesson the movie has to offer: Anna doesnt need rescuing in Frozen II, but she could use support, and rather than barging in and taking control, Kristoff respects her enough to pitch in with whatever plan she has in motion.
The visuals, imbued with an iridescent lavender-glow color palette throughout, are lovely but never overwhelming. Thats important, since computer-generated movies are capable of appearing so much better than their live-action counterparts that they sometimes fall into the trap of distracting us with the way they look. (The Lion King, for instance, exploited a magic-hour-all-the-time aesthetic that makes that elusive sheen seem less special.)
What Disney hasnt quite solved is its digitally rendered character designs, subtly altered from the earlier movie but still more akin to computer-generated Bratz dolls  with their big eyes, bobble heads and pink plastic skin  than to appealing hand-drawn humans. As a sequel, Frozen II is locked into the look of the earlier film, whereas Moana took a step in the right direction, finding a three-dimensional equivalent for the studios classical animated characters. Maybe thats a question of generational taste, as younger audiences plainly see themselves in Anna and Elsa, in both style and spirit. How fitting then, that writer-director Lees script reflects a more modernized set of values. In a world where old-timers accuse the youth of being oversensitive snowflakes, Frozen II shows what it means to have ones heart in the right place.",HAG_Doc3_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Positive,Frozen_2
3,HAG_Doc4_Frozen2,"After the colossal success of Frozen, Disneys 2013 princess blockbuster to end all blockbusters, audiences should be well aware of the mythic kingdom of Arendelle. In this haven among the icy fjords, Queen Elsa (played by Idina Menzel) and her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), have lived in peace since completing their last adventure, which revolved around Elsas magical powers and Annas poor taste in visiting princes. But hark! As Frozen II begins, Elsa starts hearing a strange noise from the north, echoing out of an enchanted forest enveloped in fog. What could lie beyond those mists? Why, its the siren song of sequel money!
Though Disney has never been averse to revisiting a story for profit, continuations of its cartoon features used to be direct-to-video. Frozen II is, in fact, the companys first-ever theatrical sequel to an animated princess film, so it has a high bar to clear simply to justify its existence. Previous follow-ups were capers like The Rescuers Down Under and Ralph Breaks the Internet; as another Disney project recently proved, its difficult to write new chapters for fairy tales with definitive endings. But Frozen was such an unprecedented smash that these omens were ignored, sending Elsa and Anna (and the directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck) into the enchanted forests mystical haze.
The result is a convoluted, sporadically sensical, occasionally trippy film that cant quite find a purpose amid all the manic world-building. Frozen II will make plenty of money and surely satisfy the younger audiences its mostly aimed at, but even as someone who enjoyed the 90s-musical throwback of the first Frozen, I found little to relish this time around. Yes, it has the brassy ballads and sparkly one-liners that helped define the Disney Renaissance style to which Frozen paid homage. But the sequel doesnt build on what made the first movie so agreeable.
For one thing, the original films central themethe power of sisterly bondsis repeated in Frozen II with minimal variation. Elsa, now confident in exploring the outer limits of her ice sorcery, is once again tempted to leave her kingdom and face danger on her own, while Anna, who is less magical but more sensible and social, tries to rein her in. The narrative arc of the sisters journey north is buried in whole snowdrifts of backstory about the past colonial sins of Anna and Elsas frosty kingdom.
It would be heartening to see this film grapple with the simplistic feudal politics of so many Disney classics, if the script could do so coherently. But Frozen II is too beholden to formula to dig deep. After all, it has to devote a chunk of time to Olaf (Josh Gad), the wisecracking snowman bumbling alongside our heroes, whos designed to earn laughs from the kids but deserves only eye rolls from anyone else. There are also further efforts to delve into Elsas supernatural background, embellishing a story arc that already felt complete.
As in the original, the songs were composed by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, who also contributed to the music of Coco. But theres nothing here on the level of the teams Oscar winners, Let It Go and Remember Me. The biggest banger of Frozen II is Into the Unknown, a honking solo from Elsa about the lure of the great beyond, which features the requisite number of soaring key changes from Menzel. Still, it doesnt quite have that magic Disney mix of earworm melody and thematically resonant lyrics; given how early in the film it comes, it almost feels like Elsa is vainly trying to sell the audience on the storys relevance.
The song I most enjoyed was a rather ridiculous power ballad titled Lost in the Woods, sung by Annas moose-riding boyfriend, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Despite his proven Broadway talent, Groff was robbed of a proper song in the first Frozen. The sequel makes up for that by giving him something straight out of the Jim Steinman songbook: a forlorn mountaineer ditty that is presented with every music-video clich in the book. This campy fun, along with Kristoffs chummy reliability, helps to lighten up a plot thats otherwise weighed down by elaborate exposition.
Frozen II sometimes gets impressionistic enough to reach the heights of its forebear, which was at its best when Elsa cut loose and made towering ice sculptures to symbolize her loneliness. A couple of sequences see the queen skiing across a raging ocean, encountering water spirits in the shape of horses, and exploring caverns of crystalline memories. Those standout moments, reliant on music and visuals, hit harder than the bulk of the dialogue. Most of the time, though, this elaborate plot doesnt yield anything remotely original. Frozen II may be big and expensive-looking, but it has no more reason to exist than the direct-to-DVD offerings Disney used to churn out.",HAG_Doc4_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Positive,Frozen_2
4,HAG_Doc5_Frozen2,"Animated adventure featuring the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood, Alfred Molina and Martha Plimpton. Written by Jennifer Lee, Chris Buck, Marc E. Smith, Kristen Anderson- Lopez and Robert Lopez. Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. Opens Nov. 21 at theatres. everywhere. 104 minutes. PG
The show-stopping tune of Disneys Frozen 2 is titled The Next Right Thing, which could also serve as the subtitle and guiding philosophy of this sequel to the 2013 animated blockbuster.
Frozen hit the jackpot. Its story of sisters Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) fighting to save their Nordic realm of Arendelle from perpetual chill struck a chord with moviegoers, aided by a catchy soundtrack that included the Oscar-winning ballad, Let It Go.
Six years later, the magic remains and the gangs all here (again), but as with almost every sequel ever made, the followup fails to top the original. Its indeed The Next Right Thing, in the sense of being second best, but its still the right thing to see for families seeking fun and adventure at the movie theatre.
Frozen directors/co-writers Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee return at the helm and the pen, with composer Christophe Beck contributing another resonant score.
Songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are back with a brace of new tunes that, if not quite the equal of the original soundtrack, still include such hummable ditties as The Next Right Thing, Into the Unknown and Some Things Never Change, plus the wistful ballad When I Am Older.
The latter is sung by comedic snowman Olaf, voiced by Josh Gad, who is a much greater presence in this film. If you found yourself wishing more of the goofy snow person from the first picture, youre in luck.
Joining Olaf for anthropomorphic sidekick antics is reindeer Sven, who acts as mute love adviser to mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), who is working up his nerve to ask Anna to marry him.
The story, co-written by many hands, is at once the same  Elsa and Anna have to team save Arendelle again, along with their extended family  while also being more complicated.
The mythology and backstory, which includes amusing callbacks to Frozen and serious resonance with real-world concerns about the environment and personal identity, recall not only the original inspiration  Hans Christian Andersens fairy tale The Snow Queen  but also The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones.
One thing that really sets Frozen 2 apart from its predecessor is the visuals, which are as gorgeous and awe-inspiring as computer animation can possibly get. Movie tech has really advanced in the past six years.
The cold wind that threatens to engulf Elsa, as she sallies forth to discover the source of a distant voice only she can hear, is as palpable as an early November storm through a summer jacket.
The film also has some of the most colourful autumn scenes of recent movie memory along with inventive uses for running water, which may not be what youd expect from a film so dedicated to winter and ice.
It just goes to show you theres still the warmth of creativity within the colourful snow palace that is Frozen 2.",HAG_Doc5_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Positive,Frozen_2
5,HAG_Doc6_Frozen2,"Three weeks after Donald Trump was elected president I went to see Disneys Moana. It made me smile for the first time since the election and cry for the hundredth. A few months later, I came out as trans and the movies power ballad, How Far Ill Go became my private little trans anthem. There was something about the simplicity of a Disney I want song that captured my intense feelings.
But the voice inside sings a different song/What is wrong with me?
Im certainly not the first queer person to project their coming out onto a Disney musical. Some people watched Pinocchio and wished to be a real boy. Others watched The Little Mermaid and longed to be part of that world. Many, many watched Mulan and wondered when their reflection would show who they were inside.
But none of these movies, not Moana, not even Mulan, elicited the same queer uproar as Frozen. By 2013, the possibility of a gay Disney movie didnt feel as far-fetched as it might have ten years prior. Mainstream LGBTQ+ acceptance was moving at a rapid pace, at least when it came to palatable queerness, and what was more palatable than a white cis femme snow queen?
While certainly unintended by its straight co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and its straight co-songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, Frozen works remarkably well as a queer allegory. Its power is not simply that Elsa reads as queer. Its the specificity of her queerness, and her struggles with that queerness, that really make it sing.
Dont let them in, dont let them see/Be the good girl you always have to be
Frozen is not about Elsa falling in love with another woman. And its not just about her feeling different and learning to accept that difference. What Frozen is really about is the guilt queer people feel when coming out  the feeling that being ourselves will hurt the ones we love most. Elsa and her sister Anna make me think about my own family members that told me again and again how hard my coming out was on them. When I watch the sisters hug at the end of the movie I feel a possibility for healing  the stuff of fairy tales, but comforting all the same.
I didnt expect Frozen 2 to give Elsa a girlfriend, despite the widespread internet campaign. I was far more worried that the perfect allegory of the first film would be ruined with the opposite. I was worried theyd give her a boyfriend. Thankfully the sequel did not make that misstep, but it makes another thats more complicated, and, in its own way, equally painful. It doesnt erase the magic of its predecessor, but it strips itself of its own potential.
If Disney wasnt ready to explicitly represent a fifth of its young audience, they couldve at least given Elsa a gal pal. I dont need to see Elsa make out with the mysterious voice calling her to the next chapter of queer life, but lord did it have to be her mother?
The plot of the sequel is both convoluted and familiar. Elsa is feeling another swirling storm inside and unleashes the power of the nearby enchanted forest. It was closed for decades  ever since her father narrowly escaped as a teen after a mysterious disaster. With the magic forces freed, Arendelle has become unlivable, and Elsa, along with Anna, her boyfriend Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and their snowman Olaf, must venture into the mystery. Elsa must follow the voice.
Are you someone out there whos a bit like me?/Who knows deep down Im not where Im meant to be?
The enchanted forest allows for some truly stunning animation, and the introduction of creatures that Im sure have already been turned into toys. But the emotional beats of the forest often feel hollow. Annas insistence on following her sister lacks the motivation of the original film, instead reading as a foolish death wish. She knows she lacks Elsas powers, so why doesnt she realize her presence is simply a burden? Allegorically, why is Anna trying to tag along with her sister to the gay bar?
But, of course, this isnt the allegory at play. When Elsa finally does discover the voice, its not a coded lover  someone a bit like her  but instead the spirit of her mother. This is made especially painful by the incredibly gay lyrics in her dead mom duet.
Are you the one Ive been looking for/All my life?
Elsas mother reveals why shes been calling her daughter to this land  and reveals the actual allegory. The inhabitants of the forest are coded as Indigenous and Arendelle was responsible for the destruction of their land. Elsas mother reveals that she was one of these Indigenous people but she rescued Elsas father out of love. Theres a moment where it seems like the movie might be making an interesting point about reckoning with a colonial past, but then Elsa finds a way to save the forest and Arendelle, and any strength in the metaphor is removed. A statue is erected to commemorate their parents love, a painfully reductive celebration of people coming together. The films take on colonialism ends up being as morally complex as Disneys Pocahontas. Ultimately, this becomes the films most abhorrent misstep, beyond its disappointing approach to queerness.
What made Frozen special as a queer allegory is it didnt require a double consciousness. Unlike other very-gay-not-gay movies, there are no scenes in Frozen that have to be ignored; no moment where Elsa is forced to engage in compulsory heterosexuality. You can enjoy the movie from beginning to end with your whole gay heart. But Frozen 2 does not allow that. Instead you have to parse through the complicated mess that is Elsa having queer longings for her mother.
This isnt to say Frozen 2 is without its pleasures. The soundtrack really is phenomenal, as is the animation. The world thats built is a joy to watch and the script is filled with a lot of fun humor. The movie also contains a thread of environmentalism that works much better than its attempts at portraying colonization. But despite these strengths, the movie just made me feel sad. When Kristoff proposes to Anna near the end of the film, I felt its message deep within me: queer children still dont get a love story.
Maybe someday well finally see the movie we deserve  a queer Disney musical that loves us back. But until then Ill listen to the Frozen 2 soundtrack and imagine it was supported by a movie with even a single snowflake of moral courage.",HAG_Doc6_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Negative,Frozen_2
6,HAG_Doc7_Frozen2,"We have seen it thousands of times in our lives but it has never felt more menacing than it does now. 
I am speaking of the digital version of the Disney logo, in which the camera swoops down from Cinderellas castle, roaming over river and dale like a hungry vulture. It runs before the start of Frozen 2, the forthcoming box office behemoth that will be holding the companys water until the next oneStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalkerdebuts in a month.
What for much of our lives felt like an invitation to magical wonder, in the days following the Disney+ takeover of our streaming habits, registers more like a declaration of lands conquered as well as something of an implied threat. The House of Mouse has long controlled our childhoods, our imaginations, our imaginations of childhood, and our debit cards. What could possibly be next?  
After spending most of its existence convincing young women that someday their prince will come, Disney made an off-brand yet largely successful play for womens empowerment with 2013s Frozen. With that films inevitable sequel, the filmmakersreturning directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, working from a script by Lee, who also serves as the Chief Creative Officer of Walt Disney Animation Studiosseem less interested in the easily meme-able and hummable girl power that made the first film so meaningful for so many. 
Instead, they have chosen to commit themselves to a rather complicated if not particularly memorable story that revolves around the sins of the lead characters grandparents. The overstuffed tale, structured Tolkien-like as a perilous quest by a party of adventurers, involves a 35-year-old infrastructure project, an enchanted forest sealed off from the rest of the world by an impenetrable fog, and a mysterious voice that keeps the headstrong ice queen Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) perpetually distracted as if shes getting texts throughout the whole movie. 
Both the songs (once again written by two-time Oscar-winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez) and the relationships between the charactersstrong points of the original filmregister with less energy and originality this time around.
Yes, the most dynamic pairing is the sisters; unfortunately, all the energy flows entirely in one direction. Anna (Kristen Bell) is obsessed with the well-being of Elsa, whose mind is on the more pressing matter of calming the nature spirits threatening to lay waste to Arendelle. The problem is so pronounced that Anna is unable to notice the absolute devotion expressed towards her by Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Annas dedication towards her sister is less admirable than it is an adult manifestation of childhood trauma that is keeping her from moving forward; it requires less a splashy song than some serious time on the therapists couch.
The silken-voiced Groff gets a sensitive power ballad in Lost in the Wood, a sequence presented in the style of an early 90s hair band video. This meta joke, more fitting in style with the humor of Dreamworks Animation movies, played gangbusters in the crowded movie theater where I saw the film, though it was hard to tell if at least some of the cheesiness people were laughing at in the clich-ridden song was unintentional. Mendel, one of the defining Broadway voices of our time, shows the ability to go from throat-lozenge slick to fire hose powerful with barely an upshift, letting it go to great effect with Into the Great Unknown.
The problem is that, while the visuals sometimes have stunning beauty and motion, there is little on screen or in the soundtrack that feels truly unknown, or carries any of the freshness of the snow that covers Elsas kingdom. Thats not to say that there arent a few surprises: Josh Gads Olaf is emotionally adroit and full of fast changes and unexpected beats. Gad, who adds comic spark to the otherwise pedestrian When I Am Older, has helped give life to a character whose steadfastness and open-hearted vulnerability has made him a worthy comedy successor to Burt Lahrs Cowardly Lion.
Its just that the world that surrounds the sentient snowman feels all too familiar, and the ideas expressed in the film are intended to fulfill built-in expectations rather than challenge us or buck long-held princess film conventions the way the first movie did so memorably. As a result, Frozen 2 has no special message to impart beyond the obvious: its Disneys woodsand were just lost in them.",HAG_Doc7_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Negative,Frozen_2
7,HAG_Doc8_Frozen2,"Two thoughts occurred while watching the sequel to Frozen. First: Man, the field of computer animation has come a long way when it comes to depicting water. Every drop of H2O here  and there is a lot of it, in the form of rippling and then rushing rivers, towering tidal waves, pelting rain, and all the chilled equivalents  looks exactly like the aqua of our world. However much money was deemed necessary to spend on perfecting the art of animating water to such photorealistic perfection, it was well-budgeted and spent. I could watch the background environmental action here for hours. But then the second thought of my Frozen 2 experience hit: I really wish I was listening to Let it Go right now.
For all the many millions of dollars thrown at Frozen 2?s next-generation computer animation, and the many millions more devoted to the films various artisans and voice performers and musicians, the new film simply doesnt sing. Not, at least, like its predecessor, which arrived in 2013 as a curiosity if not outright annoyance (a non-Pixar Disney film? Pfffft) and left that same year as a cultural typhoon wherein not one inch of the culture was safe from domination. Whatever cinematic alchemy enriched the original Frozen to such delirious heights  from the playful animation to Idina Menzels to-the-rafters rendition of Let it Go  has been since crystallized in time, never to be thawed. So returning co-directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck make do with what, only a decade ago, might be considered decent enough material to warrant a direct-to-video sequel  la The Lion King 1 1/2 or Aladdin 2: The Return of Jaffar.
The new film opens three years after the events of the first, with the superpowered Elsa (Menzel) happily if warily ruling over the wintry kingdom of Arendelle, her loyal sister Anna (Kristen Bell) by her side and still courting lovable everyman Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). Everything seems fine and frolic-y until Elsa starts hearing a mysterious siren call coming from the nearby woods, which have remain unexplored for decades due to narrative convenience. This leads the sisters, Kristoff and their crew of comic-relief things-that-shouldnt-emote-but-do  including reindeer Sven and snowman Olaf, the latter of whom is again voiced by Josh Gad and whose tenor acts as a Pavlovian prompt for parents to discreetly insert their AirPods  on a journey to uncover the origin of Elsas magic, and the dark history of Arendelle.
Theres a challenging chestnut of an idea resting inside the main story line, pivoting on Lee and Bucks desire to explore postcolonial politics and the erasure of Indigenous culture. Arendelle, you see, has only thrived because Elsa and Annas grandfather (spoiler-alert, for those who dont know how screenplays work) betrayed the trust of the areas Indigenous people. But the filmmakers potentially interesting thematic interests are slathered in slow, prosaic storytelling. Not to mention an eventual undermining of whatever good cultural intentions Frozen 2 had, given that the film is obviously more interested in ensuring Elsa, Anna and the other modern-day Arendellians come out of the mess guilt-free than anything involving, say, actual accountability. None of this should be surprising  this is reconciliation by way of Disney, sanded down and squeaky clean. What actually takes the wind out of Frozen 2?s many attempts at epic gust is its repeated failure to imagine and entertain.
Elsa, Anna and the rest of Arendelles heroes dont seem to have evolved much from the final minutes of the first film. The animation has been upgraded on a technical level  again, so much pretty water  but the enchanted forest near Arendelle feels conjured by any school-aged child with a half-decent imagination. Returning composers Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez attempt mightily to leap over the musical highs of Let it Go, but the necessary majesty just isnt there in the obvious new contenders Into the Unknown and Show Yourself. And if anyone thought that the 2017 short film Olafs Frozen Adventure pointed to an overexposure of that particular character, then Frozen 2?s many snowman-centric moments will make you pray for global warming.
So Frozen 2 mostly ends up as a cash-grab. But thanks to its brand legacy and the sheer might of Disney, youll likely be handing that cash over regardless. Make it hard. And cold.",HAG_Doc8_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Negative,Frozen_2
8,HAG_Doc9_Frozen2,"Once upon a time, Disney sent its subpar sequels to the kingdom of Straight-to-Video  a magical land filled with such titles as The Return of Jafar, Cinderella II: Dreams Come True and The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. It was a happier time, one that is now apparently over, as Frozen II hits theaters.
Thats slightly unfair. The sequel to the 2013 animated blockbuster is much better than, say, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World.
But Frozen II is still a disappointing continuation of the story of Queen Elsa and Princess Anna of Arendelle. Its been a few years since Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) learned to embrace her icy powers and settled on her throne. Little sister Anna (Kristen Bell) is still with hunky lunk Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). And may I say that it is nice to see a Disney princess in a long-term, stable relationship that suggests a real happy-ever-after? Living snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) continues to hang around, though now he has a fixation on the temporary nature of existence, really. Otherwise, things are going well in the charmingly Nordic kingdom, right up until Elsa begins hearing a lone voice singing from afar. Not long after the song begins  although only Elsa can hear it  the people of Arendelle experience some oddities, culminating in an earthquake that sends the entire population heading for the hills.
Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Kristoff, along with his reindeer buddy Sven, travel even further into the mountains, eventually coming upon an impenetrable mist  impenetrable, that is, until Elsa touches it. Beyond the veil they find two groups who have been trapped, and at one anothers throats, for 30 years: the first being several soldiers from Arendelle, and the second an Inuit-like tribe of magic-embracing people called the Northuldra.
To solve the problem of the mist  and the misunderstanding that has led to the decades-long cold war  Elsa decides to set out alone to find a river, once presumed mythical, that she hopes will have the answers to these mysteries, as well as the question of from where her powers come. Anna wants to go with her for protection. But sometimes an Ice Queen has to work alone.
Frozen II starts off on shaky ground, largely because it backtracks on much of the character development Anna and Elsa went though in the first movie. At the end of Frozen, Elsa had learned that her powers were a gift, not a burden, and she had become confident and proud in using them. At the beginning of Frozen II, that confidence is gone. She has an air of timidity that doesnt make sense, given how we last saw her. Anna, whose loneliness in the first film led her to pursue a misguided romance that nearly left her dead, seems to have settled into life with family  complete with regular Friday night games of charades. But her focus on saving Elsa from danger now seems to come from a place of desperation, rather than love.
Whatever technical advancements have been made in computer animation over the past six years arent readily apparent in Frozen II, which mostly has the same frosty look as the first film. An impressive sea battle between Elsa and a glowing ice horse  just go with it  is as good as the visuals get. There are also several moments where the action takes place against a completely black background, presumably to better set off Elsas icy creations. But its a jarring change of scenery that doesnt deliver any sort of visual or emotional payoff.
The biggest disappointment? The music. In Frozen, even the throwaway songs had wit. And the lyrics of that inescapable earworm Let It Go are actually deeply layered  a fact that is sometimes overlooked, in the face of the songs ubiquity. Both Bell and Menzel bring impressive vocal skills, and Groff, a Broadway star who only got to sing a few lines in the first film, gets his moment in the spotlight with the hilarious, 80s-inspired Lost in the Woods. But there isnt really a standout song in the bunch. Returning composers Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez try to give Elsa two showstopping numbers: Into the Unknown and Show Yourself. But neither song reaches any emotional heights. (Never mind that there really isnt a show to stop.)
Yes, Frozen II is a letdown when compared with the original. But its also a lackluster disappointment on its own  a pale shadow of what it could have been. Its hard to see how the same team who made something so cool in 2013 could deliver something so  theres no other word for it  lukewarm.",HAG_Doc9_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Negative,Frozen_2
9,HAG_Doc10_Frozen2,"Elsa does not get a girlfriend in Frozen II, with condolences to the fans who pleaded to Disney for one, like supplicants petitioning an indifferent corporate god. The frosty former princess does, however, get a magical horse, and its pretty sick. It is, technically, a water spirit called a Nokk, but what matters is that its crystalline and capable of galloping across the surface of the ocean in a way that both looks cool and makes Elsas silver hair, unleashed from its braid, flutter aspirationally in the wind. Thats the kind of sight that you can imagine making a childs heart explode with covetous delight, especially one of the little girls who were key to making the first Frozen a beast of a $1.27 billion global hit in 2013, and who pushed its breakout ballad Let It Go into brain-melting inescapability.
Frozen II is, like its predecessor, a kids movie, but its also, like its predecessor, an official Walt Disney Animation Studios release, which means its a vector for merchandise, music, theme-park rides, eventual remakes, and a young generations pop cultural pressure points. There is every possibility that Into the Unknown  the new designated banger from songwriting team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, featuring the same sort of soaring chorus and the same high note as Let It Go  will become aural wallpaper in the houses and vehicles of families around the world. The tendency people have developed to talk about these movies as bearing a public responsibility is both a symptom of our disturbingly parasocial relationship with a massive media conglomerate, and an acknowledgment of that massive media conglomerates awesome reach and influence. Disney doles out its milestones of representation in intensely calculated dribs and drabs. Itll only give one of its princesses more than an exclusively gay moment once its sure it can maximize plaudits for its progressiveness while preserving its bottom line in more repressive international regions.
Its easier to think about Frozen II as a product than as a film because a (sometimes stunning-looking) product is all that it feels like. It was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, the team behind the first film, from a script that Lee wrote, and that never really pretends that it exists because the story, rather than the market, demanded more. That story has the feel of the kind of invented errand that used to fuel countless direct-to-video sequels, only this ones been blown up to a grand scale, with accompanying sumptuous production values. Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) is now queen of the hygge-heavy kingdom of Arendelle, though shes distracted by a haunting call that only she can seem to hear. Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), still accompanied by his reindeer, Sven, is working his way up to proposing to Elsas sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). Then theres the snowman. There is, I regret to inform you, an awful lot of the snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), which, alongside Elsas ascendance to lead, indicates that some fan demands were heeded.
The group hauls off to the north in order to save Arendelle from a plot device, finding their way to an enchanted forest thats home to the Smi-inspired Northuldra tribe. The Northuldra, led by Yelana (Martha Plimpton), have a fraught history with Arendelle, once approached as allies until something went wrong and the area was sealed off by mist. The mystery behind these events will turn out to involve the colonialist ambitions of a past king and a betrayal that reveals that illustrious ancestors are rarely all theyre idealized to be  ambitious stuff from the company that made Pocahontas, though the inevitable happy resolution suggests that these films still arent exactly up to reckoning with restitutions for inherited trauma. That mystery, anyway, becomes intertwined with a journey of self-discovery involving an explanation for Elsas powers, and while that resolves in a sequence that Im still not entirely sure I understand, it does manage to once again gift the character with a gleaming new outfit.
Its hard not to feel jaded about Frozen II, while also understanding that those feelings dont matter at all, and that the film is going to go on to draw huge audiences heavy on children and accompanying parents wholl appreciate being thrown a bone by way of Kristoffs amusingly 80s-rock-inflected number. The film comes from a tradition that has spawned both incredible classics of animated artistry and overtly calculating entertainments, and it happens to skew more toward the latter. Its carefully modulated to reach the widest possible audience while offering just enough for the adults in the room to shrug and think, Hey, at least these are strong female characters, right? And the thing is that, even as a mostly mercenary endeavor, the movie is still capable of moments of astonishing beauty. Take, for instance, the sequence in which Elsa attempts to cross a stormy sea, trying and failing to use ice to crest the raging waves. Its in those waters that she battles the Nokk, eventually finding a way to get on its back and ride away triumphant. Adult me knows that thing is already available in toy stores, but child me would have died to have one.",HAG_Doc10_Frozen2,HAG,Comedy,Negative,Frozen_2
10,RIA_Doc1_SpiderMan3,"Now that summer movies have become events, it's getting harder and harder for directors to give us plain old movies anymore. Pre-release advertising and hype have become such a big part of the moviegoing experience that the pictures themselves sometimes seem like afterthoughts, the finale of an ad campaign rather than the subject of it. That's particularly true with the third installment -- not to mention the fourth or fifth -- of any given franchise: Our experience, and our enjoyment, of the previous pictures serve as a kind of internal, self-generated advertising. We look forward to what's ahead, talking ourselves out of the feeling that we already know what to expect. The good news about ""Spider-Man 3"" is that it's more of the same -- except better. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man pictures, based on the characters created by Stan Lee (who has a cameo here) and Steve Ditko, have become summer-movie staples: They're not perfect films -- they could be more resonant, more memorable. When I look back on the 2002 ""Spider-Man"" and the 2004 ""Spider-Man 2,"" I tend to remember details about certain characters (the swirling, self-motivated tentacles of Alfred Molina's Doc Ock; the icy, conflicted glare of Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn) more than I do any plot twists or overarching themes.  But even though all the Spider-Man movies, including this one, are cranked up with special effects, Raimi resists being a slave to them. His commitment to the more human aspects of storytelling is like a stubborn weed: The movies may be getting bigger, splashier, and yet Raimi's camera seems most at home when it's trained on, say, a seemingly simple restaurant scene between Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker and his girl, Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane, or M.J., Watson. The massiveness of the Spider-Man movies, including the massive expectations riding on them, may occasionally distract Raimi. But he never forgets that the human element -- the idea that even superheroes with superpowers are, in so many ways, just like us -- is the thing that makes people love comic books in the first place, and that shines through in ""Spider-Man 3."" ""Spider-Man 3"" is the most ambitious and complex Spider-Man movie yet. Its multiple plots wave themselves around, defiantly declaring their unmanageability like Doc Ock's tentacles, although Raimi does manage to wrangle them into submission by the end. ""Spider-Man 3"" sees every major character from the earlier films -- M.J., James Franco's Harry, and, of course, Peter Parker/Spider-Man himself -- making an awkward transition into adulthood. At the end of ""Spider-Man 2,"" M.J. learned Spider-Man's true identity. Now she's trying to build a career, and an identity, of her own. She's landed a starring role in a Broadway play, the kind of production that, in real life, never gets made anymore: We see her singing a plaintive version of Irving Berlin's ""They Say It's Wonderful"" as she descends one of those curving stairways to nowhere so often seen in 1930s musicals -- perhaps Raimi's way of establishing that what we're seeing is a contemporary story set in a lost world, a place where the 20th century is not yet treated as ancient history. Peter, who has decided he's ready to commit to M.J., beams at her from the audience. But it quickly becomes apparent that he's so high on his own career that he has only a cursory interest in hers. As a teenager, Peter was the dutiful nerd-turned-superhero, so busy protecting New York from supervillains that he never allowed himself the usual teenage self-absorption. Now he wants to reap the fruits of his labors: After saving the police chief's daughter, Gwen Stacy (a blond and luminous Bryce Dallas Howard), from certain death, Spider-Man is given the key to the city in a special ceremony, during which he cockily teases a kiss out of Gwen -- a reenactment of the sweetly erotic upside-down kiss, from the first ""Spider-Man,"" in which M.J. peeled back the bottom part of Spidey's mask to plant one on his kisser. M.J., a spectator at the ceremony, feels understandably betrayed. Later, when Peter sets up a dinner at a fancy restaurant -- the French-mangling maitre d' is played, as a witty little fillip, by Bruce Campbell -- during which he plans to propose to her, he prattles on about how, yes, it's true, he's become an icon of sorts. Oblivious to her suffering and feelings of betrayal over that public kiss -- and unaware that her career has taken a sharp southward turn -- he tries to play the big man, which, in his blatantly immature view, means doing more talking than listening. Peter, and Spider-Man, have even deadlier issues to wrestle with in ""Spider-Man 3"": Harry, once Peter's best friend, believes that Peter murdered his father (Dafoe's Norman Osborn, aka the Goblin, who appears here briefly in flashback), and tries to wreak revenge, becoming the new Goblin. An eager twerp of a photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), is gunning for Peter's freelance gig at the Daily Bugle, even going so far as to try to sweet-talk editor in chief J. Jonah Jameson (again played by the wonderful, cigar-chomping J.K. Simmons) into offering him a full-time position. And there's a new villain in town, a grown-up Dead End Kid in a stripey jersey named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church, in a soulful, solid performance), who has just escaped from prison, motivated solely by his wish to see, and help, his young daughter, who's suffering from a serious illness. While on the run from the police, he stumbles into the center of a particle-physics experiment, which gives him the power to transform himself into a colossus of sand: Sandman. But the biggest force of evil in ""Spider-Man 3"" is a creeping vine of black goo that trails the unwitting Peter Parker, eventually wrapping him in its warm, dark, glittering embrace. The goo, as one of Peter's professors, played by Dylan Baker, explains, is a ""symbiote"" that ""amplifies characteristics of its host -- especially aggression."" The goo-vine turns Spider-Man's vivid blue suit into a shiny black second skin, a wearable metaphor for his dark side, which now manifests itself in frightening ways. How to step into adulthood without being a jerk? That's just one of the questions Raimi, who co-wrote the script with his brother, Ivan Raimi, and with Alvin Sargent, riffs on here. ""Spider-Man 3"" is overloaded with the usual special effects, all but one of which are easily forgotten: There's simply very little that's particularly new or exciting about Spidey's swinging between and around skyscrapers while assorted baddies try to cut him down. And ""Spider-Man 3,"" like the two pictures that preceded it, suffers from an overall lack of cohesiveness: The picture is entertaining enough as you're watching it, but afterward, the picture still feels like a bunch of events strung together, more than a rich, fluid whole. But ""Spider-Man 3"" is a vast improvement on the last picture in the franchise -- in which the chemistry between M.J. and Peter was barely an afterthought -- and it's a deeper, richer picture than even the first ""Spider-Man."" Raimi and his co-writers have taken care to give the relationships between the characters more tangible contours than in the last picture, and the actors give better performances as a result. Dunst has more sparkle here, and Maguire draws some surprising creepiness out of his usual boy-next-door demeanor. Of all the actors here, though, Franco is the one who has improved with each successive picture: As a young man battling his own dark side, he brings smudgy layers of depth to a character that might otherwise be a cartoon. In one sequence, a verbal face-off with Peter, his left eye droops in a sinister, lazy appraisal of his sometime best friend; the moment suggests that Franco might have more to show us than most of his roles have required of him. ""Spider-Man 3"" doesn't have the operatic dazzle of the first X-Men picture, or the mournfully poetic quality of the often, and inexplicably, maligned ""Superman Returns."" But Raimi at least manages to make it both huge and human. He also pulls off one of the most beautiful special effects I've ever seen, in any movie, a testament to the ways in which CGI, used right, can actually humanize a film. After Flint Marko -- a criminal who's done all the wrong things for the right reasons -- steps into that whirling particle-physics blender, he's no longer himself: He's a mound of sand, a one-man desert, and before our eyes he tries to re-form himself into some semblance of the man he used to be. As he tries to stand, rivers of sand run from his muscles. His contours take shape, fall away, and then stubbornly rebuild themselves: He's a piece of sculptural poetry, a song of being and becoming, a living, moving Henry Moore statue. Eventually, a bigger-than-life creature, an anguished giant, emerges from this hill of sand. He's clutching a locket containing a photo of his little girl, and as he surveys this tiny picture, we know that he's remembering not just the man he used to be, but the man he failed to be. In this one astonishing scene, Raimi and his special-effects artists give us an image redolent of the great beauty, and the gravity, of silent film. Without a word, they sing the ballad of the disappearing man.",RIA_Doc1_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Positive,Spider_Man_3
11,RIA_Doc2_SpiderMan3,"History has proven that movie sequels rarely exceed their original, but as we already know, “Spider-Man 2” holds its place in history as one of the very few to ever do so. The 2004 follow-up to Peter Parker’s origin story offered better drama, action and special effects, not to mention the most engaging character study of any superhero to grace the big screen. It’s an even rarer feat, however, for the third installment of a trilogy to live up to its predecessors, but “Spider-Man 3” pulls it off almost effortlessly, thanks in part to the return of the same creative team from the first two films. Offering better action, unrivaled special effects, and yet another inner struggle for our main protagonist, “Spider-Man 3” is most certainly the must-see event of the summer. Unless you’re one of the few people that haven’t seen the first two films, number three starts out by integrating a highlight show into the main credit sequence. From there, the story picks up right where the last one left off. Oozing with confidence now that Spider-Man has become a national icon, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finally musters up the courage to ask Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him. But while Peter’s confidence is at an all-time high, Mary Jane’s has hit rock bottom. She’s just been fired from her first Broadway play, and she doesn’t find much solace in Peter’s cocky behavior. The arrival of a new romantic foil – Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard), the daughter of the city’s police chief (James Cromwell) and Peter’s college lab partner – only adds to her jealousy. Meanwhile, Harry’s (James Franco) personal vendetta against Peter is put into motion when he reveals himself as the new Goblin; small-time crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) – and Uncle Ben’s real murderer – becomes the web-slinger’s latest arch-nemesis when he is transformed into the shape-shifting Sandman; rival photographer Eddie Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) battles Peter for the open staff position at The Daily Bugle; and an alien symbiote that feeds off negative energy attaches itself to Spider-Man, creating a not-so-friendly version of Spidey. If that sounds like a lot of information, it’s because it is, and although the movie is noticeably longer than the first two, there’s still not enough time to properly develop every subplot. It’s not the new players that suffer, however, but rather supporting characters like Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) who get the shaft. Other familiar faces, like Dylan Baker as Dr. Curt Conners and Bruce Campbell (this time in a hilarious cameo as a French maitre d’), also make apperances, but they're still shortchanged in favor of the visually appetizing villains. The decision to introduce three new baddies was a brave one, but director Sam Raimi pulls it off with fairly well. Thomas Hayden Church is effective as Sandman – the most prominent of the group – and is even given a motive similar to that of Doc Ock’s from the second film, while James Franco does his best work of the trilogy under the guise of the Goblin. Unfortunately, neither actor is quite as memorable as Willem Dafoe (“Spider-Man”) or Alfred Molina (“Spider-Man 2”), so it’s Topher Grace as fan favorite Venom that ultimately steals the show. Of course, a character of his stature would have better served as the primary villain of a future installment, so here’s hoping that the writers find a way to reintroduce him later on down the road. As far as the film’s two stars are concerned, not much has changed since the first movie premiered in 2002. Maguire and Dunst remain well-cast in their respective roles – despite the fact that neither is a particularly talented actor outside of the franchise – and we can only hope that they’ll agree to reprise these characters for as long as Sony continues to make “Spider-Man” movies. Sam Raimi has certainly shown signs of growth, though, and while he’s always inserted his trademark humor into every installment of the series, it’s more prominent here now than ever. Add to that some great action sequences, groundbreaking special effects, a few classic baddies and a story that leaves no questions unanswered, and it’s easy to see why “Spider-Man 3” doesn’t disappoint. Sam Raimi and Co. have not only made one of the biggest films of the year, but they've succeeded in creating an entertaining bookend that’s almost as good as its predecessors, and for that, they deserve every dollar this box office beast rakes in.",RIA_Doc2_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Positive,Spider_Man_3
12,RIA_Doc3_SpiderMan3,"After two movies of reluctant hero Peter Parker learning that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" it is a nice change of pace that ""Spider-Man 3"" is about something else entirely-forgiveness. It also takes a little bit of the audience's forgiveness to accept this third installment as a worthy successor to what remains the best superhero movie ever made. What 2004's ""Spider-Man 2"" had that this new chapter lacks is economy of story. An early version of the script for ""Spider-Man 3"" was so long that there was talk of splitting it into two movies. Seeing the finished product, this is no surprise. ""Spider-Man 3"" juggles so many storylines and fits in so many amazing action sequences that it feels like three movies all by itself. That said, bigger may not necessarily be better, but it's still pretty damn good. What a feat that this is the third film that accomplishes the goal director Sam Raimi set for the movies from the beginning. It grounds Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) in emotionally real situations, even if extraordinary things are happening all around them. Despite a complicated plotline that introduces three new villains, the ""other woman,"" and an inner conflict both mental and physical, ""Spider-Man 3"" is really about three friends finding their own identity and having the courage to forgive. ""Spider-Man 3"" assumes by now that one recognizes the conceits of the superhero movie and dispenses with some minor details. While Peter and MJ's relationship falls on hard times, a meteor falls from the sky and a mysterious black substance attaches itself to Peter, amplifying his feelings of jealousy and anger. Raimi and his co-writers, Alvin Sargent and brother Ivan, barely have enough time for everything else, so they certainly aren't wasting it on an explanation of the where's and why's of alien goo. There's also escaped convict Flint Marko, perfectly embodied by the bulky frame and damaged eyes of Thomas Haden Church, whose singular drive to steal money for his sick daughter leads him to a test facility of some sort. There his body is somehow combined with the molecular structure of sand-think ""The Fly"" but without all the nasty side effects-and he sets off to New York City to rob banks. Raimi's motif of keeping it personal extends to the Sandman, too, when we learn he is the actual shooter in the death of Peter's beloved Uncle Ben. As if these trespasses upon the sacred text of comic books weren't enough, hardcore devotees will certainly be angered further by the inclusion of Peter's classmate Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and rival Daily Bugle photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), whose characters also fail to follow the plots established in the Marvel comic. Like any good adaptation of a longer literary work, the best screenplays are the ones that put the characters through the same emotional journey as the book, even if the hoops they had to jump through to get there are different. ""Spider-Man 3"" pulls this off, and it is no small task considering all the dangling storylines that need to be resolved. Even the story thread that is the most clumsily executed-that of best friend/sworn enemy Harry Osborn (James Franco)-feels like a satisfying conclusion when it is all said and done. ""Spider-Man 3"" is the longest film in the series, clocking in at 140 minutes, but dare I say it should have been longer in one respect. Harry could have used more screen time to convincingly cover the vast spectrum of his character arc. One key moment with his butler is over way too soon and feels especially false, like a last minute addition to save time and move the narrative to the final showdown more quickly. The sense of humor that was such a welcome addition in part two is back in ""Spider-Man 3."" Some lighthearted fare is showcased with another very funny cameo from Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" comrade-in-arms Bruce Campbell as a wry maÃ®tre de in a French restaurant. But when Peter's dark side takes over, things go from silly (Maguire's mock disco moves and emo haircut) to scary (cruelly mocking MJ at her lowest point) real quick, and it gives Parker welcome and unexpected depth. The goody two-shoes hero is suddenly testing the audience's loyalty like never before, resulting in a more well-rounded and imperfect stature. ""Spider-Man 3"" has the ""big event"" kind of special effects that you crave out of a summer movie and then some. Raimi's camera is again constantly spinning around during every fight scene, to give the audience a dizzying and complete perspective of the action. This time around, however, they are longer and more impressive-and not just the super-battles. A vertigo-inducing rescue mission with an out-of-control crane on a Manhattan skyscraper is as unsettling as Marko's sand transformation scene is beautiful. Although ""Spider-Man 3"" bites off a bit more than it can chew in the plotting department, it doesn't skip on character development, which is a hallmark of this series and the thing that sets it apart from its superhero kin. Raimi and crew have crafted a movie that feels like the fitting conclusion to an exciting story, even if it can't quite match the dramatic heights of its immediate predecessor. Let's hope that if Spider-Man does return, that it is with this same visionary team.",RIA_Doc3_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Positive,Spider_Man_3
13,RIA_Doc4_SpiderMan3,"You’ve probably seen Spider-Man’s new black suit, a costume guaranteed to arrive on your doorstep this Halloween on many an 8-year-old. The color change, brought about in “Spider-Man 3” by an alien parasite that (briefly) darkens Peter Parker’s heart and mind, might have you thinking that the latest Spidey installment heads into more brooding territory than its predecessors, but that’s not really the case. And it can’t be the case, because writer-director Sam Raimi believes too much in Parker’s goodness and essential nerdiness to build Spider-Man his own version of the Bat Cave. “Spider-Man 3” may not be as good as the second entry in the series and it may introduce a few too many new characters without giving them enough depth, but it does move and it does entertain and it does make you smile. Let Raimi make another trilogy if he wants to. I’d watch them in a heartbeat. The movie begins with Peter (Tobey Maguire) reveling in the love he’s receiving from Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Spidey’s loyal public. Now that he doesn’t have to keep his identity a secret, Peter can relax with Mary Jane on a web hammock, counting shooting stars on a beautiful summer night. Problem is, one of those shooting stars happens to be a meteor that (huge coincidence) lands right near them. This meteor contains the alien parasite that will lead to Black Spider-Man. Peter’s peace is about to be pickled. It’s not just the alien parasite and it’s not just the revenge-minded Harry Osborn (James Franco) looking to squash Spidey. There’s also the shape-shifting supervillain Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and an amoral tabloid photographer (is there any other kind?) named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) looking to take Peter’s job at the Bugle. One more wrinkle: Mary Jane’s mojo isn’t working on Broadway, and a new girl, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), is catching Peter’s eye. With all the villains, is there room for a green-eyed monster? Why not? To the credit of Raimi and co-writers Alvin Sargent and Ivan Raimi (Sam’s brother), the overstuffed plot of “Spider-Man” remains clear and hurtles forward. Some characters don’t pay off until the movie’s thrilling finale; others (notably the thinly sketched Gwen) will have to wait for another movie. Sometimes the movie feels a bit episodic, and sometimes that doesn’t matter because the episodes (especially the one involving Bruce Campbell’s fussy French maitre d’) are so wonderfully realized. If it takes another movie – a “Spider-Man 4” is inevitable – to get Gwen Stacy going, you could point to “3’s” finally nailing the Peter-Harry rivalry as an example of good things sometimes taking time. Thanks to a bout of amnesia, Franco’s Harry goes all Jekyll and Hyde, allowing Franco the chance to flash his charm and million-dollar smile. Watching Harry play Peter for a fool is almost as much fun as seeing Peter, infected by that creepy-crawly alien virus, turn into an egotistic emo rocker, strutting through Manhattan like a geeky Tony Manero to the James Brown funk classic “People Get Up and Drive Your Funky Soul.” Peter’s “dark” night is a lot more fun than a certain Dark Knight, and indicative of a comic-book franchise that never loses its mission to engage and enthrall.",RIA_Doc4_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Positive,Spider_Man_3
14,RIA_Doc5_SpiderMan3,"Spider-Man 3 director Sam Raimi has had a difficult task set before him: He has to follow himself. Spider-Man 2 is easily the best superhero movie ever made, and topping it is nearly impossible. For the third film, Raimi has waved the white flag and tried to make a bigger movie instead of a better one. He succeeded. Spider-Man 3 has more of everything. More villains, more love story, more fight scenes. It’s bigger, but it’s not better. For a change everything is going right for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). The lovable loser from Spider-Man 2 has blossomed into a beloved hero. Peter has the adoration of the city and he has the girl of his dreams too. He and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are dating, and Peter has plans for marriage. Sure, he still lives in that crummy little apartment but he’s found a way to make time in his life for everything he cares about. Things are going pretty well for Peter Parker, so of course it’s time to pull the rug out from under him. Things may be going well for Peter, but that doesn’t mean he’s solved any of the problems created in the previous two films. They’re still there lingering and they come to a head in this film. For instance Peter has never really come to grips with the murder of his uncle, and then there’s his friend Harry (James Franco) who still blames Peter for the death of his wacked out, Green Goblin father. There’s a lot going on in Spidey 3, but at its heart Alvin Sargent’s script is about Spider-Man getting right all the things he’s been getting wrong. Unfortunately that sometimes gets lost in the noise of the film, which falls prey to the same trap almost every third superhero movie seems to, by trying to do too much at once. Luckily unlike those other failed third superhero movies, Spider-Man 3 is the first of its kind to keep the same cast and crew together through three films. That’s enough to keep it swinging. Still there’s no denying that trying to squeeze so many different villains into a single movie hurts it. This time Spidey is fighting three bad guys instead of one and since Raimi is too good a storyteller not to, each has been given a complex back story to explain their evil motivations. But there’s just never enough time to explore each of them fully. All three villains are so good that each could easily fill his own movie full of Spidey vs. bad guy grit. Cramming them all into a single feature leaves you with a film that feels like it’s trying to do too much all at once, probably because it is. There’s just no way to make the multiple superhero thing work properly and Spider-Man 3 would have been better off avoiding it, or at least settling on two bad guys instead of three. Sadly that was not to be and all three: New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom end up splitting their bad guy screen time pretty equally until the film’s end when everyone and everything collides together for a big, spectacle packed finale. With three super-powered bad guys though, they really take the action up a notch in this one and because Sony was willing to give them all the money they wanted, Raimi isn’t afraid to pull his camera back for plenty of spectacular, stunning, wide shots of what’s going on. Spider-Man 3 is easily the most satisfying of the three movies on a purely action oriented level. From his thrilling mid-air battle with New Goblin to the film’s massive cage match between Spidey and all three bad guys Spider-Man 3 really delivers on non-stop punches. The effects haven’t necessarily gotten better since Spider-Man 2, but there’s a lot more of them. This is also the Spider-Man movie that has the most Raimi in it. Sure Spider-Man 2 had a few of those signature Raimi moments, but Spider-Man 3 is dripping with Raimi’s wry sense of humor and distinct behind the camera horror style. When Peter Parker goes bad under the influence of the Venom symbiote they’ve been pumping so much in the trailers, it’s then that Sam seems to be having the most fun with the movie. Peter goes emo and dances down the streets of New York shooting people with cool guy style in a sequence that’s a complete departure from anything we’ve seen in these movies till now. Bruce Campbell has his biggest cameo of the series in this one, and it’s every bit as genius as we’ve come to expect from any Raimi/Campbell collaboration. Spider-Man 3 is by far the most playful of Raimi’s three Spider-Man movies, and even though it may not be as dramatically satisfying it compensates by simply being a lot of fun. The problem with the film dramatically isn’t simply that there are too many bad guys. Though that’s certainly a large part of it, there’s also too much of everything else too. Too many side characters, too many angsty romance flourishes. There are times when I think even Raimi gets lost in his own movie. In more than one place plot threads are started and then randomly abandoned without satisfactory explanation or resolution. The rift that develops between Mary Jane and Peter Parker for instance is never fully explored. Worse, Mary Jane’s behavior later in the movie becomes completely bizarre and inexplicable. Most of her actions seem to be dictated by what they need to happen in order for the plot to move forward, not by what makes any kind of sense for her character. Some are probably going to blame Kirsten Dunst for this; after all she’s always been the weak spot in Spidey’s pictures. But I think it’s simply an editing problem. It feels like there are big pieces of the movie missing, and most of them involve her. With so much to cram into the film, something had to be cut in order to keep the running time down at a manageable level, and it’s Mary Jane that suffers. The biggest go-nowhere in the movie is their new female addition Gwen Stacey, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She serves no real purpose in the story, since they don’t have enough time to take her sub-plot anywhere. Worse, Howard’s simply not believable as Stacey. She’s supposed to be the super-model daughter of the city’s police commissioner, but let’s face it: Bryce Dallas Howard has cankles. She’s pretty in a girl-next-door sort of way and a decent actress, but to ask her to convince us she’s a model is beyond Howard’s ability to portray. As with Mary Jane, Raimi seems to have a problem with casting proper female leads. Actually, flip the two and you might have something. Bryce Dallas Howard would have made a perfect Mary Jane and Kirsten Dunst almost certainly would have been a better Gwen Stacey. Despite it’s bigger isn’t always better problems, I don’t think anyone is going to be disappointed in this third Spider-Man. It’s easily the best third superhero franchise movie ever made (of course it’s up against Superman III, Batman Forever, and Blade Trinity so it’s not like the competition is very fierce). Tobey Maguire is still brilliant as Peter Parker and most of the supporting cast, both old and new is so good that they leave you wanting more of them. There are three amazing movies wrapped up in Spider-Man 3. Instead of doling them out one a time, they’ve been webbed together and delivered as one pretty good one. The world would be a better place if Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire went right on making Spider-Man movies together forever.",RIA_Doc5_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Positive,Spider_Man_3
15,RIA_Doc6_SpiderMan3,"Doubling back to pick up some titles I missed in the year. The great failing of ""Spider-Man 3"" is that it failed to distract me from what a sap Peter Parker is. It lingers so long over the dopey romance between Peter and the long-suffering Mary Jane that I found myself asking the question: Could a whole movie about the relationship between these two twentysomethings be made? And my answer was: No, because today's audiences would never accept a hero so clueless and a heroine so docile. And isn't it a little unusual to propose marriage after sharing only one kiss, and that one in the previous movie, and upside-down? Faithful readers will recall that I found ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) the best superhero movie since ""Superman"" (1978). But I made the mistake of declaring that was because ""the movie demonstrates what's wrong with a lot of other superhero epics: They focus on the superpowers, and shortchange the humans behind them."" This time, I desperately wanted Peter Parker to be short-changed. If I argued earlier that Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent were boring human beings, I had no idea how Peter would begin to wear on my nerves. And what's with Mary Jane? Here's a beautiful, (somewhat) talented actress good enough to star in a Broadway musical, and she has to put up with being trapped in a taxi suspended 80 stories in the air by alien spider webs. The unique quality of the classic comic books was that their teenagers had ordinary adolescent angst and insecurity. But if you are still dangling in taxicabs at age 20, you're a slow learner. If there is a ""Spider-Man 4"" (and there will be), how about giving Peter and Mary Jane at least the emotional complexity of soap opera characters? If ""Juno"" (opening Dec. 14) met Peter Parker, she'd have him for breakfast. Superhero movies and Bond movies live and die by their villains. Spidey No. 2 had the superb Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), who is right up there with Goldfinger and the Joker in the Supervillain Hall of Infamy. He had a personality. In Spidey No. 3 we have too many villains, too little infamy. Take the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). As an escaped con and the murderer of Uncle Ben, he has marginal interest at best. As the Sandman, he is absurd. Recall Doc Ock climbing buildings with his fearsome mechanical tentacles and now look at this dust storm. He forms from heaps of sand into a creature that looks like a snowman left standing too late in the season. He can have holes blown into him with handguns, but then somehow regains the bodily integrity to hammer buildings. And how does he feel in there? Molina always let you know precisely how Doc Ock felt, with a vengeance. Then there is the black microorganism from outer space, which is not a villain, but plays one in the movie. It arrives on Earth in a meteorite that lands, oh, maybe 20 yards from Peter and Mary Jane, but this impact somehow escapes notice by the fabled Spidey-sense. Then it produces little black beasties that look like squids crossed with licorice rope. They not only coat people with a way-cool black glossy second skin, but specialize in spray-painting Spidey and Spidey wannabes. No ups, no extras. We know that Spider-Man's powers do not reside in his red suit, which lies in a suitcase under his bed. So how do fake Spideys like Venom gain their powers when they are covered with the black substance? And how does a microorganism from outer space know how to replicate the intricate patternwork of the Spidey costume, right down to the chest decoration? And to what purpose from an evolutionary point of view? And what good luck that the microorganism gets Peter's rival photographer, Eddie Grace, to infect, so that he becomes Venom! And how does Eddie know who he has become? Another villain is Harry Osborn, a k a the New Green Goblin (James Franco), son of the interesting original (Willem Dafoe) but not a drip off the old gob. While the first GG had the usual supervillain motivations (malevolence, envy, twisted abilities) his son is merely very angry and under the misapprehension that Peter/Spidey murdered his old dad. And then Peter and Harry have a fist fight when they should be doing Spidey and Goblin stuff. Yes, there are some nice special effects in the movie. I liked the collapsing construction crane sequence. But the damsel in distress this time was not Mary Jane but Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the sexy blond lab partner Peter has somehow neglected to mention to Mary Jane, causing her heartbreak because at a civic ceremony he kisses her with our kiss, i.e., the upside-down one. While Peter goes through a period of microorganism infection, he combs his hair forward, struts the streets, attracts admiring glances from every pretty girl on the street, and feels like hot stuff. Wait until he discovers sex. ""Spider-Man 3"" is, in short, a mess. Too many villains, too many pale plot strands, too many romantic misunderstandings, too many conversations, too many street crowds looking high into the air and shouting ""oooh!"" this way, then swiveling and shouting ""aaah!"" that way. And saints deliver us from another dinner date like the one where Peter plans to propose to Mary Jane. You know a movie is in trouble when the climactic romantic scene of the entire series is stolen by the waiter (Bruce Campbell). And poor Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). An actress of Harris' ability, asked to deliver a one-note performance, and that single note is fretting. How could Sam Raimi, having gone so right with ""Spider-Man 2,"" have gone so wrong with ""Spider-Man 3""? Did the $250 million budget paralyze him? Has the series grown too heavy on its feet? How many times can we see essentially the same romantic scenario repeated? How much dangling in the air can one girl do? And how does Spidey keep his identity a secret anyway, when there are more arrivals and departures through his apartment's window than on a busy day at LaGuardia?",RIA_Doc6_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Negative,Spider_Man_3
16,RIA_Doc7_SpiderMan3,"In ""Spider-Man 3,"" an upstanding franchise gets its comedownance. After two epic successes that deserved their success, the latest installment swings between intense action sequences and unaccountably flat dramatic interludes. (They're truly unaccountable in a production that, by another accounting, may have cost more than any other in movie history.) The film also suffers from a surfeit of villains. Poor Spidey must contend with three bad guys -- though one of them has amnesia-related mood swings between nasty and nice -- plus the über-villain of a script fixated on the settling of old accounts, and the recycling of old themes. While it's too harsh to suggest that what was fresh has gone completely stale, the truth lies in between, as with day-old bread. Saying this brings no pleasure. Of all the recent comic-book transplants to the big screen, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker has been the most likable, quirky and reliably human, even when he's squirting web-juice from his hands as the semi-superhuman Spider-Man. And the series has gained in grace from Peter's fraught love for Kirsten Dunst's winsome and endearing Mary Jane Watson. Yet the third go-round conventionalizes its hero by throwing him into repetitive struggles with his dark side. (Clothes and the man make each other here, since the black symbiotic substance that's responsible for his darkness and alarming arrogance turns his costume from red and blue to jet black.) And the script traps him and M.J. in a domestic struggle that's straight out of ""A Star Is Born."" The borrowing is not the problem: ""Disturbia"" borrowed an entire plot from ""Rear Window,"" but added value that young audiences responded to. The problem is that this particular borrowing in its comic-book context casts an emotional pall. Audiences will, of course, turn out in staggering numbers for ""Spider-Man 3,"" which, like its two predecessors, was directed by Sam Raimi, and find plenty of special effects to keep them pop-eyed. But they'll find that Mary Jane, who realized Spidey's identity by the end of the last film, has become a killjoy -- unpleasantly envious of his celebrity, and sexually jealous in the bargain. (M.J.'s singing career on Broadway is going badly, which shouldn't be a surprise, because she doesn't sing very well.) She and Peter go back and forth. She rejects him, he rejects her, and that symbiotic substance briefly turns him into a not-so-funny stud who might have strayed from the set of ""Saturday Night Fever."" But the whole movie keeps going back and forth -- between his domestic distress and his troika of adversaries, none of whom musters a scintilla of the evil allure exuded by Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, the tentacled cyborg who enlivened ""Spider-Man 2."" One of them, the veteran Marvel comics villain Sandman, is an impressive digital creation who looks like a cross between a beige ""Hulk"" and the silicon swirler in ""The Mummy."" (His solid-state incarnation, Flint Marko, is played, flintily, by Thomas Haden Church.) A second Marvel staple, the toothsome, fearsome Venom, is another ritualized manifestation of the bad black stuff: He's played in human form by Topher Grace, who has some fun with the role of a sleazy photographer. As if those two weren't enough, Spidey must further contend with the on-again-off-again rage of his erstwhile friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), who holds our hero responsible for the death of Harry's father, the extravagantly crazed Green Goblin, and seeks revenge by transforming himself into the much less extravagant New Goblin. Will the extremely extravagant special effects prove sufficient to sustain the picture? Surely they will, this time. Still, there's a sense of fatigue in the scenes that don't involve high-tensile webs and high-tension suspense. At one point Peter's landlord, noting his tenant's erratic behavior, says: ""He's a good boy. He must be in some kind of trouble."" He is.",RIA_Doc7_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Negative,Spider_Man_3
17,RIA_Doc8_SpiderMan3,"If ever a movie had a case of the blues and the blahs, it's ''Spider-Man 3,'' the third and what feels like the end of Sam Raimi's big-screen comic-book adaptations. (Ready or not, the studio is talking about a fourth.) Aesthetically and conceptually wrung out, fizzled rather than fizzy, this latest installment in the spider-bites-boy adventure story shoots high, swings low and every so often hits the sweet spot, but mostly just plods and plods along, as if its heart were pumping tired radioactive blood. Maybe it's middle age. In fictional terms Spider-Man a k a Peter Parker a k a Tobey Maguire looks like he's pushing 23, but there's something about the guy that shrieks midlife crisis. Peter is still hitting the books and still snapping photographs for The Daily Bugle, run by the flattop blowhard J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons, in clover, as usual). It's a living, kind of, enough for an enviably situated dump in Manhattan with artfully peeling walls and a fabulous picture window through which Peter regularly bounds into the air in full superhero drag. (The neighbors in this part of town evidently always keep the blinds drawn.) It's a calling, sort of, though it's also started to feel a bit like punching the clock. The programmatic screenplay credited to Mr. Raimi, his brother Ivan Raimi (a third Raimi brother, Ted, plays a tiny role in the picture) and Alvin Sargent certainly feels more like work than play. The big selling point in ''Spider-Man 3'' is that Spider-Man or Peter or some combination of the two discovers his so-called dark side when an inky extraterrestrial glob (a symbiote in Marvel-speak) spreads its gooey tentacles over his body, turning his suit and soul black. Though there's something dubious about the idea that black still conveys evil in our culture, pop or otherwise (tell it to Batman and Barack Obama, for starters), the idea of messing with Spider-Man's squeaky-clean profile, smearing it with dirt, a touch of naughtiness, seems too good to resist. It's also too good to be true. There's no knowing if the problem is bottom-line reserve, or a lack of imagination or creative nerve, but Spider-Man's voyage into darkness turns out to be little more than an overnighter. The goo transforms Spider-Man, but the alteration barely registers. There's some wacky, misguided nonsense involving Peter's super-inflated ego and Mr. Raimi's apparent desire to direct a musical, as well as fleeting nastiness with a resurrected foe, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), recently escaped from prison. Marko has the makings of a super-antagonist, and Mr. Church brings a touching delicacy to the few short scenes in which you can see his face, the skin pulled back so tightly that you fear his jagged cheekbones might pierce right through. With his hard-body physique and a striped shirt that evokes a 1930s chain gang, Marko also feels and looks like a fugitive from an earlier era, one of the film's many such nostalgic flourishes. Marko's earthbound trudge makes it seem as if he's dragging a literal ball and chain, not just the baggage of a sick daughter and a cranky missus (Theresa Russell, in and out like the Flash). And when he rises from a bed of sand after a ''particle atomizer'' scrambles his molecules, his newly granulated form shifts and spills apart, then lurches into human form with a heaviness that recalls Boris Karloff staggering into the world as Frankenstein's monster. There's poetry in this metamorphosis, not just technological bravura, a glimpse into the glory and agony of transformation. It's this combination of exaltation and dread that can come with radical life change that made the first film work as well as it did. The first ''Spider-Man'' never soared, but there was something very appealing about the image of a skinny, geeky adolescent struggling to rise to the occasion of his newfound powers, like a 97-pound weakling tiptoeing on the beach after getting with the Charles Atlas program. Part of the allure of superheroes, of course, is how they serve as wish fulfillments for the faithful, allowing their mild-mannered fans to settle scores and snare the babe by proxy. But nothing seems to put a damper on interesting self-doubt faster than fame, or so this film and its lead character both seem intent on proving. Success may not have spoiled Mr. Raimi as it has Peter Parker, but it seems as if it has zapped his gracious good humor, which was so critical to the first two films. The story this time unfolds as a series of increasingly dreary and teary melodramatic encounters regularly interrupted by special-effects-laden fights. As it happens, the over-all shape does recall a Busby Berkeley musical -- snappy story, lavish number, snappy story, lavish number -- but without the snap or fun. Peter ignores his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), so she reaches out to her friend and his frenemy, Harry Osborn (James Franco), a k a Son of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, revived in flashback), while Peter turns to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who shovels the manure with grace. And so it goes as the Sandman cometh and goeth and a twerp named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace, running fast with a small role) throws a couple of monstrous hissy fits. Bryce Dallas Howard shows up to smile at the camera, as does a marvelous Bruce Campbell, who almost swallows it whole. Ms. Dunst looks a bit lost, at times even bereft, but you want to catch hold of her story line and follow her home. When she tramps across the screen, this wispy, sad-eyed beauty turns into Melancholy Girl, able to melt hearts in a single glance. For his part Mr. Maguire needs to stop relying on those great big peepers of his: simply widening your eyes to attract attention does not cut it when you're over 30. It's hard not to think that Mr. Raimi would rather follow Ms. Dunst to wherever her story might take them too. And while Marko is mainly around to show off the franchise's snazzy special effects, it feels as if the director has put quite a bit of himself into the Sandman, whose struggle to find a form that suits his talents has the sting of a metaphor. The bittersweet paradox of this franchise is that while the stories have grown progressively less interesting the special effects have improved tremendously, becoming at once more plausible -- when Spider-Man swings through the urban canyons he finally looks almost real -- and more spectacular. In Sandman you see the vestiges of Mr. Raimi's personal touch slipping through a nearly empty hourglass.",RIA_Doc8_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Negative,Spider_Man_3
18,RIA_Doc9_SpiderMan3,"Superheroes tend to dwell on their outsized insecurities lately, so maybe this was inevitable: A hero whose emotions spiral out of control, villains who ""mean well,"" no end of anguish over the leading lady's singing career --all shot in close-up so the movie will look good when it's played on cell phones in a few weeks. With four separate subplots and more twists than a daytime soap, Episode Three of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series plays like As the Web Turns. With special effects. One very special effect sends a construction crane swinging through an office building, presumably so the audience can stop worrying for a moment about the chief bad guy's daughter's life-threatening illness. I say ""chief"" bad guy because there are three this time, and that's not even counting the mysterious black goo that turns everyone it touches into either a revenge-crazed freak or a bad dancer. We'll get to the bad dancing in a moment, but first the three bad guys: There's Spidey's estranged best friend, who's morphed into Green Goblin Junior. There's Venom, who's not much more than a mess of black goo — with fangs. And there's Sandman, who gets ""de-molecularized"" in the film's coolest effect and becomes the object of Spider-Man's goo-fueled ravings. If you're over 13, this is all allegedly interesting because of the special effects — which are pretty special, if a little videogame-y. They're also consequence-free, since nobody even gets bruised when crashing through brick walls. Sandman gets his face shaved off by a passing train, after which he merely re-molecularizes. You sort of have to de-molecularize your brain to stay engaged. Happily, the screenwriters still have good old Aunt May around to remind us that there's a message. ""Revenge is like a poison that can turn us into something ugly,"" says actress Rosemary Harris to Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker at one point. Makes your Spidey-sense tingle, doesn't it? Now, there are some real-world parallels for a super-powerful American (with black goo possibly coloring his thinking) who imagines he can take on the world's bad guys all by himself — especially when you throw in a revenge motive centered on a father figure, people falling from pulverized skyscrapers and enough swirling sand to suggest a Middle Eastern desert. I'm not sure these parallels have actually occurred to Raimi, but when Spidey finally decides he needs ""allies"" to fight the evildoers, he does put on his red-and-blue suit and swing in front of an American flag. Isn't comic-book-land refreshing? Now, about that bad dancing I mentioned earlier. Aunt May said revenge can turn you ugly, and Raimi illustrates that notion not just with the black goo, but by dressing Maguire in a skinny black suit and having him sleaze his way around a dance floor. Wait'll you see how much editing it takes to turn him into a sort of Eurotrash John Travolta. Worse, Raimi photographs his star from odd angles, making him look puffy during love scenes and awkward when he's not being digitized in Spidey spandex. We're supposed to sympathize with this guy, but when I eventually did, it was mostly because I'd started to wonder: ""What's a poor superhero to do when not just three villains, but even his director, have turned against him?""",RIA_Doc9_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Negative,Spider_Man_3
19,RIA_Doc10_SpiderMan3,"""Spider-Man 2"" was a textbook example of how to make a sequel: Deepen it, make it funnier, give it more heart and come up with a strong villain and a good story. ""Spider Man 3,"" by contrast, shows how not to make a sequel. The film takes three bad stories and tries to fashion a narrative out of them. It can't be done. It also takes established and warmly regarded characters and has them behave in ways that make no sense in terms of what we know about them. And, perhaps to give the movie the illusion of scale, it contains many empty conversations -- scenes in which characters dither and nothing happens. Word to the wise: Whenever Rosemary Harris shows up as Peter Parker's beloved old aunt, it's safe to run out and get popcorn. Even the special effects take a step backward. Body movements are awkward. The elastic springing of Spider-Man as he vaults and swings from the tops of buildings looks unnatural, too often like something on a computer screen. The effect isn't helped by director Sam Raimi's choice to film a lot of the hand-to-hand combat in close-ups in quick cuts, which sometimes makes it difficult to track what's going on. Little imprecisions in the effects wouldn't matter if the other aspects of the film were working. But ""Spider-Man 3"" screws up even some of the more reliable elements, most notably the relationship between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Things start well. Mary Jane has a singing part in a Broadway show, and Peter goes to see her. The reviews are awful, and that's a potentially interesting and satisfying direction: Dunst, who does her own singing, really does sound amateurish. But the movie doesn't build from that in a coherent way. The script hints that maybe being Spider-Man is going to Peter Parker's head, but it doesn't commit to that course. It suggests that maybe Mary Jane is becoming jealous of Peter's success, but it doesn't follow through on that, either. It just keeps feinting in various directions, and in the process it distorts Peter and Mary Jane's relationship. At times, the plotting is so flimsy that it rolls out the oldest and least forgivable trick in the book: It depends on Peter and Mary Jane's not talking when they most certainly would, not telling each other things they definitely would say. That's just cheap, and it betrays these characters who've been lovingly built over the course of two features. Three stories are set in motion in the movie's first minutes: (1) Harry Osborn (James Franco), Peter's old friend, decides to follow in his Goblin father's footsteps, and becomes Spider-Man's nemesis; (2) The criminal (Thomas Haden Church) who killed Peter's saintly uncle (Cliff Robertson) is transformed, through a process of disintegration and reintegration, into an unkillable Sandman; and (3) An alien substance -- black and elastic -- comes to earth in a meteorite and finds its way to Peter's apartment. It's all marginally interesting, but there's one thing missing: a real villain. Harry Osborn is a confused young man, not the essence of evil, and Sandman, though a destructive force, is as mournful as Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolfman. He's not a driven adversary. He's more like a sad mope. The most promising plot element is the black elastic substance, which attaches itself to the body as a second skin and emphasizes whatever latent, dark traits its wearer might have. But Raimi and his associates let that element lie dormant for almost half the movie's running time, when a good story might have been fashioned from that concept alone. Epics are made from stories that demand the epic treatment. A story has a certain scale and grandeur, and the act of doing justice to it results in an epic. That's the right way to do it. The wrong way is to decide you want to make a big movie and then, without much to say, you proceed to throw every possible idea at the screen in the hope it'll work out. That's what Raimi does in ""Spider-Man 3,"" which is so clumsy that at times one can sense the filmmaker artificially slowing down one story in order to pursue another. Maguire and Dunst are appealing as always, even though they'd be better off with stronger material. Actually, the whole world of the ""Spider-Man"" films is appealing, which is what saves this entry from disaster. At 140 minutes, it's not a difficult movie to sit through. It's just difficult to enjoy.",RIA_Doc10_SpiderMan3,RIA,Action,Negative,Spider_Man_3
20,CAA_Doc1_Cruella,"Of all the Disney villains in history, there are none quite so devious as Cruella De Vil. Royal traitors like Jafar and Scar take the prize for most ambitious, but there’s a particular black heartedness to planning the murder of a hundred adorable puppies simply for something nice to wear. A coat which, by all accounts, Cruella would have likely forgotten about or thrown out the moment she was tired of it. There’s no sin more original than that, so it’s easy to understand why you’d want to make a movie about that person. Why ‘Cruella’ decides to tell the story about such a villain with a sympathetic view? Your guess is as good as mine. Still, that’s the tale that is told in the live action ‘Cruella’ in which Emma Stone plays a relatable young fashion designer with a bit of a mean streak. Early in the movie Cruella’s life as a young girl named Estella, shows that mean streak in its infancy. She’s hot tempered and will get herself into trouble as naturally as a dalmatian wears its spots. Rarely though is her bad action unfounded. Her methods are extreme but the film always roots her reaction in empathy. Cruella is a protagonist you can easily get behind, especially given her storied past. Soon after, Estella becomes Cruella proper, and unfolds the mystery of her past, while making an explosive entry into the London fashion scene. Standing in her way is Emma Thompson’s The Baroness. Whereas the Cruella we all know and love would announce her presence by storming into a room and shouting at the top of her lungs, the Baroness has a much more somber approach, while being just as soul crushing. Think Miranda Priestly meets Nurse Ratched, and throw in a british accent for good measure. It’s a combination that’s riveting to watch, especially when the two Emmas go head to head. Not to mention their punk rock accompaniment, as the film puts its 1970s setting to good use with an fun and energetic soundtrack. Their battle of wits plays out with some delicious verbal sparring, and their performances deserve acclaim. Still, the real heavy hitter in this film is Academy Award winning costume designer Jenny Beavan, whose previous work includes ‘Mad Max: Fury Road’. The sheer volume of outfits worn by Stone and the rest of the cast, is matched only by the level of detail on each. The designs are the subject of some of the films most iconic shots, like when Cruella is carried off by a garbage truck and the 40 foot train of her dress, made entirely out of discarded clothing, follows behind her. Visually, ‘Cruella’ is striking and impressive. It helps to keep you engaged with the film, especially when its more distracting elements emerge. The film’s cg visual effects are perhaps the most egregious. Cruella has two canine companions that are unfortunately not as polished as the rest of the film and stand out in the worst way. For a film series that owes its entire existence to dogs, you’d think they would at least do them justice on the big screen. Even at it’s worst, ‘Cruella’ manages to sweep you off your feet with style. So much so that I was willing to forgive it for its admittedly minor offences. Emma Stone’s Cruella does not feel like the iconic original, but she carves out an identity of her own all the same. Then again, breaking the rules and bucking expectations for the sake of it, is about as Cruella as you can get.",CAA_Doc1_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Positive,Cruella
21,CAA_Doc2_Cruella,"As candidates for image rehab go, 101 Dalmatians' Cruella de Vil poses a particularly vexing challenge. The lady is most famous for trying to make coats out of stolen puppies — vile stuff even by villain standards, and difficult to explain away. So the new Cruella hardly bothers to try, choosing instead to tiptoe around it in killer stilettos. Cruella, a character once memorialized in song as ""an inhuman beast,"" is reimagined as Estella (Emma Stone), a fashion genius who's not so much evil as misunderstood and maligned — not unlike Tonya Harding in director Craig Gillespie's last film, I, Tonya. Her backstory is framed as a more unhinged Devil Wears Prada, with Emma Thompson filling the role of the boss from hell. (In fact, The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna gets a ""story by"" credit here.) As a prequel, it's half-baked nonsense. As an excuse for the two Emmas to trade ever-bitchier quips and ever-more-outrageous outfits, it's a ball. But Cruella needs to make a few stops before we get there. In its first half, the film skews more sweet than spiky, charting her journey from birth to grade school to a budding criminal career. Young Estella finds a family of sorts in fellow misfits Horace (Paul Walter Hauser, a cheerful scene-stealer) and Jasper (Joel Fry, a low-key heartthrob), and the three grow up picking pockets together in 1970s London — often with the help of their beloved dogs Buddy and Wink, because Cruella cannot emphasize enough that Estella is not the anti-canine monster you remember from those other movies. It's not until Estella lands her dream job working for a high-fashion designer called the Baroness (Thompson) that she turns heel into Cruella, and even then it takes several plot twists to get her fully there. When she does, though, it's worth the wait. Estella is a role Stone could play in her sleep, cute and clever and easy to root for. Cruella, on the other hand, feels like Stone stretching her wings. With the help of a slinky walk, an extra-husky voice, and costumes to die for (oh, we'll get there), Stone refashions herself into the diva we never knew she had inside her. And still she's eclipsed, intentionally, by Thompson, who not only matches Stone's Cruella smirk for smirk and insult for insult, but makes it look effortless — she'll ruin a person's whole life with less thought than she puts into her lunch order. Liberated from the burden of trying to appear even remotely relatable, Thompson plays up the Baroness's terrifying iciness; she is to this movie what Cruella herself was in the Dalmatians movies, which I suppose means she'll be due for her own revisionist prequel in about two more reboot cycles. The most purely pleasurable stretch of Cruella comes in its middle, when these larger-than-life figures battle for headlines with increasingly elaborate gowns and the stunts to show them off. (This film takes place in a universe where one designer upstaging another is considered front-page news, and I want to go to there.) The Baroness's dresses are stunning in their own right, all luxe fabrics and elegant silhouettes, but it's in Cruella's that costume designer Jenny Beavan truly outdoes herself. Cruella's designs are deliberately alienating, even ugly, and get edgier as she falls further into her wicked side; at one point, she literally turns trash into couture. They're outfits dreamed up by a woman who cares less about looking beautiful or tasteful than in making you look, period, and they represent as strong a statement about the character's renegade spirit as anything in Dana Fox and Tony McNamara's script or even Stone's performance. These clothes are the boldest element of a movie that otherwise wears its supposed punk-rock influences like a kid discovering Hot Topic for the first time. Fun though it is, Cruella defaults too frequently to the safe and obvious: You can tell immediately that this is the kind of movie that's going to have the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" on the soundtrack, and lo and behold, there it is. Even the script struggles to leave well enough alone, padding its 135-minute run time with not just an extensive voiceover but multiple scenes in which Estella recaps recent plot points, and Dalmatians references that feel more obligatory than organic. Then again, these are choices that make perfect sense for a family-friendly Disney crowdpleaser —which is what this actually is under all that jet-black eyeliner, even if Cruella and Cruella would prefer you to forget from time to time. Seen in that light, stacked against the studio's other recent live-action remakes, reboots, prequels, and sequels, it stands out as a pleasant surprise. Like the fashionista who gave it its name, Cruella is less interested in retracing old visions than dreaming up new ones, having a good time, and looking fabulous while doing it. And also like Cruella, it succeeds with flying colors.",CAA_Doc2_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Positive,Cruella
22,CAA_Doc3_Cruella,"As the saying goes, hurt people hurt people—or in this case, puppies. Cruella is the latest film in a recent barrage of villain origin stories that attempt to humanize antagonists by inventing past trauma. And as with other mononymous prequels, including Maleficent and Joker, Cruella leaves us wondering why. Part heist, part mystery, the movie is fun, stylish, and over the top (in mostly a good way), but it struggles to prove that it’s more than a muddled cash grab. Buried under couture looks and a pop song–riddled soundtrack is a film attempting to say something edgy about women’s genius being stifled and the futility of playing by the rules. Instead of achieving this goal, Cruella romanticizes girlbosses who treat those around them poorly in order to claw their way to the top. Just because a movie leaves audiences with unanswered questions doesn’t mean it needs a prequel. And just because a villain is a woman doesn’t mean she needs to be redeemed.  Set in the ’60s and ’70s, Cruella first introduces viewers to the vampy fur obsessive during her childhood, which is, of course, tragic. Born Estella (Tipper Seifert-Cleveland) with naturally two-toned hair, the future puppy-napper is a goodhearted but erratic and strong-willed child. Her mother, Catherine (Emily Beecham), gives her the nickname “Cruella,” and while she recognizes her daughter’s talent for fashion design, she also encourages her to suppress her wild side in order to stay out of trouble. Predictably, Estella ignores her mother’s advice and is expelled from school, setting off a chain of events that end in disaster. Catherine dies in a much-mocked scene involving—you guessed it—dalmations, and orphaned Estella begins a life of petty crime after befriending two young pickpockets. Ten years later, Estella (Emma Stone) is still living with her comrades Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser).  Though the three are getting by as thieves, Estella still dreams of breaking into the fashion world. She gets her chance during a zany mishap at the Liberty department store where she works, when she catches the eye of renowned, egomaniacal designer Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), who offers her a job. This is when the prequel really begins: Estella slowly transforms into Cruella as she learns more about the Baroness, discovers truths about her own past, and unapologetically embraces her talent. Cruella is undeniably entertaining, and there are plenty of bright spots, but with a run time of more than two hours, it’s about 30 minutes too long. The writers use that extra half hour to insert tidbits from Dodie Smith’s 1956 novel, The Hundred and One Dalmatians, and introduce other familiar characters. In Cruella, Estella knows journalist Anita Darling (Florisa Kamara at age 12, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste as an adult) from school, just as she does in Smith’s book, and songwriter Roger Dearly (Kayvan Novak) can be heard singing Mel Leven’s “Cruella de Vil” from the 1961 animated movie One Hundred and One Dalmatians.  The main cast’s performance is also a highlight: In Cruella, as in The Favourite, Stone proves she’s good at being bad, Thompson is delightfully deranged as the Baroness, and the rest of the actors are clearly having a blast. The needle drops are crowd pleasing, albeit a bit much (I rolled my eyes when Blondie’s “One Way or Another” began playing over a montage of Cruella’s subversive fashion moments). And the costumes by Oscar-winning designer Jenny Beavan are as fabulous as those familiar with her work expected them to be. But when it comes to the plot, the movie begins to fall apart. In an Associated Press interview, Thompson describes the film as a “redemption story going backwards.” If the prequel was intended to redeem its namesake as Thompson says, it misses the mark. The movie doesn’t quite know who it wants this new Cruella to be. Is she a villain? An antihero? An anti-villain? In transforming her from an innately evil millionaire to an orphan who has independently overcome obstacles through inborn genius and hard work, Disney—one of the largest corporations in the world—is telling on itself.  More important, most people with difficult childhoods don’t become puppy killers. In fact, no part of the past Disney has created for Cruella indicates she will eventually skin dalmations, and the movie never explicitly explains why she despises them. Instead the film repeatedly indicates that despite her mom’s death, she not only tolerates but actively likes dogs. Although the movie intends to illuminate her motivations, they remain remarkably unclear. The ending, in particular, is a head-scratcher. Cruella offers more filler than useful information, and it feels like a prequel to a prequel, setting the stage for additional trauma to come. (Both Stone and Thompson have said they would do another movie to fill in the gaps, but sometimes it’s best to let sleeping dogs lie.) It’s also difficult to make sense of the film’s distorted politics. In the same AP interview, Thompson says that Cruella tackles “the idea of a woman being ruthless in order to release her creativity.” Sounds like some girlboss nonsense! She goes on to quote her character, who tells Cruella, “If I cared about anyone or thing, I might have died like so many brilliant women with a drawer full of unseen genius and a heart full of sad bitterness.”  The movie is full of faux-feminist capitalist platitudes such as this, and it’s unclear how viewers are supposed to receive them. The Baroness is abusive and sociopathic, but she believes gender-based oppression is real. Cruella follows in the Baroness’s footsteps to become similarly egotistical and murderous, but she had a hard childhood and has a gay friend, Artie (John McCrea). Are we supposed to clap? Despite these missteps, the New York Times declares that “If you set aside the dognapping and puppy-skinning plots (which are, admittedly, hard to overlook), Disney’s version of Cruella has always been a bit of a feminist fantasy.” In addition to the fact that you can’t brush off animal abuse (Cruella’s entire schtick), bad behavior doesn’t become feminist simply because a woman is the perpetrator. Like The Queen’s Gambit, Cruella also falls into the white feminist trap of using characters of color to facilitate a white woman’s journey without attempting to develop their interiority. At one point, Cruella storms into Anita’s office and tells her old friend, who in this version of the story is Black, “I want you to help me tell them who I am.” Presumably this is meant to be a girl-power moment, in which two women team up for a greater cause, but it’s really just about Cruella’s self-aggrandizement.  The Disney villain cinematic universe seems to characterize feminism thusly: When men are abusive, it’s the patriarchy; when (white) women are abusive, it’s empowerment. But no matter how you slice it, girlbosses are just…bosses. It’s fine to allow some antagonists, including women, to be irredeemable. There are plenty of interesting stories about legitimately misunderstood women to explore on the big screen—Lilith and Medusa come to mind. And, heck, as entertainment writer Abby Monteil tweeted, there are even other compelling women side characters in the same franchise who could use origin stories. Ultimately, Cruella is a Disney movie: It’s amusing and light—not necessarily trying to present a cohesive worldview or do much more than make money. But this cinematic tradition of retroactively excusing these characters’ atrocious behavior—or, worse, peddling it as feminism—feels out of touch. If a woman is bad, let her be bad.",CAA_Doc3_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Negative,Cruella
23,CAA_Doc4_Cruella,"“It’s time to make some trouble. You in?” reads one of the posts promoting Cruella, Disney’s prequel-meets-reconsideration of the classic One Hundred and One Dalmatians villain. The line is in keeping with the film: It’s slick and witty and teasingly imprecise about what “trouble,” in this context, might entail. Previous incarnations of Cruella de Vil—including the 1961 animated film that gave us a song dedicated to her vileness—have paid fealty to the character’s outlandish fiendishness: This is someone who will attempt to murder puppies in order to make outerwear. The new version, which tells of Cruella’s life as a young fashion designer, both complicates and flattens the existing stories. Played with off-kilter aplomb by Emma Stone, the young Cruella is a hustler, a skilled self-promoter, and an influencer. She is not evil; she is merely complicated. She is a creature of 2020s America who happens to reside in 1970s London.  Cruella is the latest entry in the thriving genre of villain revisionism. The field includes lightly fictionalized reconsiderations of nonfictional events (works such as Confirmation and The People v. O. J. Simpson); documentaries such as The Clinton Affair, Lorena, and Framing Britney Spears; and retellings of old tales (Wicked, Maleficent) from the villain’s point of view. The genre is not new, but it is flourishing in an age shaped by the internet and fluent in the language of postmodernism: It tells the story about the story. It is deeply concerned with the totalizing power of authorship. It understands that villainy, as a category, is imposed—and that, in a culture that tends to prioritize reductive myths over complicated truths, the label can be its own kind of injustice.  Disney’s latest film is both an apotheosis and a nadir of the form. It goes out of its way to complicate, to relate, to correct. It takes a character so evil—so delightfully depraved—that she is named after the devil himself, and promises that she, too, can be rehabilitated. Its impulse toward retrospective empathy, however, strains credulity. (When a reassessment depends on the murderous capabilities of a dalmatian named Genghis, perhaps it has gone too far.) The Cruella you might know from earlier iterations is all but unrecognizable. Her defining cruelty has been switched out for the demands of glossy, girlboss feminism. Cruella is often fun to watch—it features some fantastic performances, some excellent lines, and some dazzling clothes—but its cavalier reversal of its core character cheapens the very idea of a corrective narrative. It takes a quintessential villain and nuances her character into oblivion.  Here is one simple way to render your villain instantly sympathetic: You make her the victim of trauma. Cruella begins, as many Disney stories do, with a child witnessing the death of a beloved parent. In this case, Cruella blames herself for the tragedy. Orphaned, she makes her way to London, where she takes up with two boys (this is how Jasper and Horace, Cruella’s eventual henchmen, enter the story). The three support themselves through thievery; she puts her great design skills to work creating elaborate costumes that enable their grifts. Everything changes when Jasper, recognizing her talent, gets her a job at a high-end department store. That leads to a job with the Baroness, the apex predator of London’s fashion scene. Cruella quickly discovers—and, warning, here are some spoilers—that the Baroness was responsible for her mother’s death. Driven by a desire for revenge, which might also be a desire for justice (the film is unclear on this crucial distinction), Cruella becomes a fashion star intent on displacing the Baroness. Heists and society balls and operatic plot twists ensue.  At no point, in this film based on 101 Dalmatians, does Cruella put dogs’ lives under threat. She makes some winking jokes about killing dogs and, for that matter, people. It is crucial to the film’s project that she never follows through. This Cruella is “bad” but not evil, and much depends on the difference. Instead, the cruelty in Cruella is outsourced: The villain is the Baroness, played with razor-sharp hauteur by Emma Thompson. She is calculating and cutting (sometimes literally: She nicks Cruella with a fabric cutter and, enchanted by the blood rather than abashed by it, orders staff to procure a fabric in the same color). She says things like “You’re helpful to me, is all. As soon as you’re not, you’re dust.”  The Baroness is emblematic of the film’s frenzied effort to have things both ways. The original Cruella is a great villain in part because her evil is so delightfully two-dimensional, so transcendentally cartoonish. She utters deliciously demonic lines (“Poison them! Drown them! Bash them! Drop them on their head! Got any chloroform?”) about adorable puppies. But Cruella, having argued that its main character is fundamentally good, cedes that depravity to the Baroness. As for Cruella, the traumatized orphan? She is seen scrubbing toilets (her job at the department store, it turns out, is janitorial) and being belittled by an imperious manager. The bids for sympathy are heavy-handed. How will Cruella finally break bad? Unclear. And not the point.  Another way that the film complicates its compassions: Cruella, in this rendering, is not one person but two. The character’s most defining physical feature—her starkly split-colored hair—has a psychological upshot. She is both Cruella (who is “born brilliant, born bad, and a little bit mad”) and Estella (who loved her mother and is essentially kind, if rebellious). This is a well-worn trope: Cruella/Estella is a version of Clark and Kal-El, Arthur and Joker, Jekyll and Hyde. But the bifurcation is so muddled that Cruella herself has to constantly clarify which of her alter egos she is embracing at a given moment. “I’m Cruella,” she will say, to her colleagues and the fourth wall. “Are you Cruella or Estella?” other characters will ask.  In some stories, the alter ego can be a way of exploring the elemental idea that people have dual, and sometimes dueling, capacities for goodness and badness. Here, though, the trope is used in much the same way that childhood trauma is: as a plot device, and as a way of making Cruella a character who offers something for everyone. Is Cruella good or bad? She is both. She is neither. She is exceptional. She is relatable. After a while—Cruella has a two-plus-hour running time—all the whiplash begins to look like indifference. The film’s efforts to frame its protagonist as a feminist antihero take the form of easy currency. Helen Reddy’s “I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar” is referenced unironically. In one scene, the Baroness utters the line “I choose me.” The whole thing can read, at times, as a game of corporate-feminist Mad Libs made corporeal.  “Each film is only as good as its villain,” Roger Ebert once observed, and the older Dalmatians films show why. Their stories have been elevated by Cruella’s delicious deviance. In her recent book, Women and Other Monsters: Building a New Mythology, Jess Zimmerman quotes Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, the dean of humanities at Arizona State University: “The monster dwells at the gates of difference,” he notes, in one of the insights that inform his seminal book Monster Theory. Monsters, Zimmerman argues, “separate acceptable from unacceptable, what’s allowed from what is not. Their monstrosity is deviation blown up to exaggerated size—the mythic equivalent of ‘if you keep doing that, your face will stick that way.’”  This is part of the visceral thrill of cinematic villainy. Villains tend to be much more entertaining to watch than heroes because their embrace of aberrance can be cathartic: They acknowledge the constraints imposed by cultures that are narrow in their empathies—and then studiously ignore them. Many of Disney’s greatest villains are coded as queer for this reason. (The Little Mermaid’s Ursula was inspired by Divine, the famous drag queen.) These characters dwell at the gates of difference and, crucially, have no interest in residing anywhere else.  Cruella nods to that transgressive power—and also reduces it. The queer character here, Artie (John McCrea), is not a villain but a friend of Cruella’s who happily agrees to serve as one of her assistants. Several other people in the film, two of them characters of color—including Cruella’s childhood friend Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a main character of 101 Dalmatians—are similarly cast as cheerful agents of Cruella’s will. For a movie premised on corrective vision, these treatments are notably myopic. Cruella adopts The Queen’s Gambit idea of success; its plot assumes that everyone in Cruella’s world will happily drop what they’re doing to help her exact her revenge (or is it justice?). The film insists that her success is success for anyone who has been marginalized. She is an outsider, after all. Her clothes suggest the avant-gardism of Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen. And yet: “I want to be like you,” she tells the Baroness. “You’re a very powerful woman.” So Disney has given us an allegedly punk antihero whose defining goal is to be respected within the establishment.  Every age gets the Cruella it deserves. The Cruella of the 1990s, an era whose mass culture was inflected by feminist backlash, was made monstrous not just by her murderousness, but also by her acute disinterest in marrying or mothering. (“Puppies, darling,” coos Glenn Close, infusing the role with maniacal glee. “I’ve no use for babies.”) The Cruella of the current moment—frenzied, flattened—is an icon for a time that finds the slogans of “empowerment” easy and the substance of empowerment hard. The film embraces the glib condescension of the idea that every villain must be, somehow, misunderstood—that a woman can’t be purely evil, that she must have a softer side, that her currency is her beguiling relatability. Watching this sumptuous revision, I longed for the classic Cruella: vain, vapid, willing to kill puppies, and never feeling the need to explain herself.",CAA_Doc4_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Negative,Cruella
24,CAA_Doc5_Cruella,"That Cruella is an atrocity with neither purpose nor soul shouldn’t come as a surprise. It is, after all, another in a long line of IP mining nostalgia and better works of the past that Disney is more than happy to keep churning out. Hollywood is an industry too myopic to understand its past and too inert to move into a more artistically dynamic future. But it’s the way this tepid film operates that makes it galling.  The pleasure of Cruella de Vil — first voiced by Betty Lou Gerson in the 1961 animated adaptation and later played by Glenn Close in the 1996 live-action film — is her outrageous style and cruelty. She is a woman intent on skinning Dalmatians to make herself a coat. Here, Cruella, played by Emma Stone, is softened and made aspirational. She’s given a loyal pooch as a sidekick so you know for sure she wouldn’t kill animals herself for the sake of fashion. (Although there is a throwaway joke about skinning Dalmatians that nods to her beginnings.)  The film begins with Cruella’s birth, depicting her mop of half-black and half-white hair as natural rather than an aesthetic choice. Born Estella, we see large swaths of her adolescence in the mid-’60s when she’s played by the precocious Tipper Seifert-Cleveland. She’s framed as such a rabble-rouser that the world doesn’t know what to do with her. She gets into fights at her prep school until she’s kicked out. She’s lonely; her only companion is a loyal puppy she finds who remains by her side. What splits her life in two is the death of her mother, who is knocked off the side of a grand, cliff-side estate by some (CGI) Dalmatians that were originally chasing Estella. She blames herself for her mother’s death and makes her way to London, where she falls in with Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser). They become lifelong friends, bringing her into their world of grifting and petty thievery. The bulk of the film takes place against the backdrop of late-1970s London, mining this setting for its various uprisings and counterculture dynamics. Eventually, she takes a job working for the Baroness (Emma Thompson), a conniving designer as haughty and fashionable as she is cruel to her staff. Estella sees her as a mentor, but grows angry when she learns more about her boss’s horrifying behavior (she is an unrepentant baby killer, among other atrocities). It’s here when Estella decides to become Cruella, setting her sights on usurping the Baroness as a designer.  Cruella, the film and the character, postures with an off-the-rack punk sensibility, as if Disney could hold even the echo of counterculture when it is the dominant culture itself. If you look closely, Cruella is indicative of the very culture it pretends to critique: Its central character is a white woman whose concerns and politics begin and end with herself. She’s a girl boss pretending to fight against the powers that be. She doesn’t want to overthrow the Establishment so much as become it. Cruella takes one of the richest narrative archetypes — the madwoman — and whittles her down into a glossy, hollow, capitalism-approved monster fueled by girl-boss politics. It has nothing to say about how women move through the world.  It’s hard to know where to begin with the aesthetic failures of this film. There are odd choices, like the insistence on conveying information through newspaper headlines superimposed on a scene. The scenes at night made me wonder if cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis forgot how to light properly in order to convey information. This is especially frustrating in the climax of the film, which is so pallid and gray I could barely make out details. The needle drops are especially confounding. They either feel odd, pointless, or utterly random, as if to showcase the depth of Disney’s pockets. Or in the case of “These Boots Were Made for Walking” — which plays when Cruella gets drunk on her boss’s whiskey and redesigns a window in the Liberty of London store out of anger — a way to drive home the thin pop-feminist thematics. The costume design, led by Jenny Beavan, is sometimes beautiful. It takes its cues from the works of Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen, lending Cruella a punk air and the Baroness an austere quality. There are reams of crimson taffeta. Cruella’s trademark hair is fashioned into a crown. Swooping gold collars frame her face and shoulders. There are slinking gowns, towering heels, bodices thick with jewelry and boning. But all this beauty feels inert as it’s in service of a story that feels confused about what it wants to be and who the character at its center is.  You’ve seen the madwoman before. She’s your ex-girlfriend with smeared red lipstick refusing to quiet her anger during an argument. She’s the former wife trapped in the attic whose machinations have been branded unfit for society. She’s every woman who has been called “too much.” Cruella director Craig Gillespie, who previously helmed the miles-better I, Tonya, told the L.A. Times something that made it clear the madwoman was on his mind while making the film: “As a character, we’ve created this journey for her where she has this inner voice and she has this talent she’s trying to express. But she’s penalized for it because it’s outside of the constructs of society at the time. She’s in this rigid English system where you can’t be outside the lines.” But there’s nothing in the story that truly expresses Cruella’s inner life or makes clear the dynamics that would deem her as someone living outside the bounds society had formed for women at the time. “I’m Cruella. Born brilliant. Born bad. And a little bit mad,” Cruella says with authority at one point, as if merely uttering those things could make them true.  Classic Hollywood often excelled at depicting the inner lives of madwomen, most resplendently within the women’s picture — a strange genre spanning from the 1930s to the 1950s that only ended because of the fall of the original studio system. This genre made stars out of women like Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck. Its films considered the sexual, financial, and psychological aspects of womanhood with a fiercely defined aesthetic, narrative grace, and truly dynamite acting underscored by a proto-feminist perspective. Cruella limns how Hollywood has learned all the wrong lessons from the 1950 powerhouse film All About Eve. In that film, the older woman who is being manipulated by an ambitious younger fan is the focus. Ever since then Hollywood has discarded considerations of ageism. Older women — in this case, the Baroness, whom Thompson plays with a touch of boredom — are the villains. It’s telling, too, that the luminescent Black actress Kirby Howell-Baptiste, who plays the deliciously named but poorly written Anita Darling, is slotted into the role of the friend who helps Cruella along her journey to become a fashion designer. She’s a tool for Cruella, not a defined character. What Cruella does have to say about womanhood is rooted in youthful whiteness. All of the film’s issues are rooted in its perspective on power, from who gets it to who truly deserves it.  It’s a wonder that Tony McNamara, who has a screenplay credit along with Dana Fox, could be involved in this given his intriguing work on the venomous The Favourite and the delightful series The Great. (Story-by credits go to Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel, and Steve Zissis.) No lead actress could save a film so poorly conceived, aesthetically facile, and narratively rote, but Emma Stone is a particularly disappointing choice. In the past, I’ve enjoyed Stone’s work in The Favourite … and that’s pretty much it. But watching Cruella led me to look at that performance from a different perspective. I realized it wasn’t so much what Stone was doing that piqued my interest, but how the character was framed visually and written. In Cruella, Stone sounds like what an alien who only ever saw American actors playing British characters would think a British person sounds like. Her gestures are empty — a flourish of the wrist, the way she rolls or widens her searchlight eyes. Everything feels underlined in a way to mark Cruella as weird and different from her surroundings. But it just feels silly and poorly thought out. She lacks a sense of play. She doesn’t feel bold enough to fully rock the ostentatious frocks she wears. You can’t help but think of the camp extravagance Glenn Close brought to the role in 1996 and yearn for such a daring approach. Ultimately, Stone does not offer us a window into who this woman is, beyond a vehicle for mining IP.",CAA_Doc5_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Negative,Cruella
25,CAA_Doc6_Cruella,"There’s not much of One Hundred and One Dalmatians author Dodie Smith’s source material or its classic 1961 animated adaptation to be found inside Disney’s Cruella, and I’m perfectly okay with that. Transplanted to a punk rock London of the 1970s, this isn’t so much an origin story for the iconic fashionista villainous with a murderous thing for spotted puppy fur as it is an alternate reality where a similar character takes her first stiletto-heeled steps into her own fabulously coifed tomorrow.  Directed by I, Tonya and Lars and the Real Girl filmmaker Craig Gillespie and with a story and script credited to five writers (including The Favourite scribe Tony McNamara and The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna), the finished product can feel a bit messy, especially during its convoluted second act. But the opening hour is dazzling, while the climax is a crackerjack barnburner of suitably cartoonish rage and whimsically rambunctious adrenaline. The film is a heck of a lot of fun, and even at 134-minutes it still managed to keep my full attention for the most of its epic running time.  Estella (Emma Stone) is a twenty-something orphan living on the London streets with her two best friends and partners in pickpocket crime Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser). The young woman has talent as a seamstress and fashion designer, and she harbors dreams of going to work for the legendary Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson).  When the opportunity to do so arises seemingly by chance, after earning the Baroness’ trust and becoming a valuable member of her design team, Estella is shocked to discover her icon harbors a devasting homicidal secret directly connected to the tragic death of her mother roughly a decade prior. Determined to exact revenge, she develops a colorfully aggressive alter ego named “Cruella,” a rival up-and-coming designer who wants to dethrone the fashion industry’s reigning queen.  It’s not a ton of plot, and as elaborate as the scenario gets, there still isn’t a valid reason for this story to be stretched out to well over two hours. But that opening section is incredible. There is a passionate female-centered strength to the world Gillespie has created that’s exceptional, and the ways he allows Stone so much freedom to make Estella/Cruella her own cannot be understated. The fusion between actor and character is seamless, and I loved the underlying emotional ferocity which hypnotically fuels her performance.  As terrific as Stone is, however, Thompson comes remarkably close to stealing the motion picture right out from underneath her co-star. The Baroness is a magnificent villain, her venal self-righteous narcissism beyond anything I could have imagined. Thompson brings a level of sanctimonious sincerity to the proceedings that’s sublime, her lithe, almost serpentine physicality adding an additional layer I found impossible to resist.  There is a point where things begin to stumble and fall apart. The seams start to show, and Gillespie has to rely on a few well-placed needle drops to help keep narrative momentum moving forward at a spirited clip. This is a bit lazy in my opinion, and I do wish he’d have allowed Nicholas Britell’s (Moonlight) fabulous score to do more of the musical heavy-lifting instead of turning to the likes of The Rolling Stones, Ike & Tina Turner, The Clash, The J. Geils Band, Judy Garland, Blondie, Queen and many others for a far-too-obvious assist.  Other areas I could pick a few nits include how Jasper and Horace are sidelined during the laborious middle section and the almost inexcusable way in which Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) is utilized as a prop and not a full-blown character. There’s also a vital subplot involving The Baroness’ trusted valet John (Mark Strong) which is far too contrived to satisfy, and I may have rolled my eyes during a pivotal reveal involving the character’s connection to Estella.  These annoyances are moderately mitigated in large part courtesy of the charming performances of the actors, Fry and Hauser particularly outstanding. There is also the bravura work turned in by costume designer Jenny Beavan (Mad Max: Fury Road), her spectacular collection of frocks, business suits, punk jackets and casual wear arguably the film’s third most important character behind Estella and The Baroness.  Thankfully the climax truly is wondrous, Gillespie recapturing the riotous, anything goes mania of that opening hour with stupendous aplomb. Cruella roars back to life with thunderous intensity, delivering a crowd-pleasing ending that had me wanting to rise out of my seat to cheer. I had a blast, and much like 2015’s Cinderella and 2016’s Pete’s Dragon, this is one Disney live-action remake worth getting excited about.",CAA_Doc6_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Positive,Cruella
26,CAA_Doc7_Cruella,"Character names don’t come any better than Cruella de Vil — you know, the fur-loving, dog-detesting “One Hundred and One Dalmatians” villainess with the shock of white hair. The 1961 Disney animated film got a live-action remake in 1996 as “101 Dalmatians,” with Glenn Close sinking her canines into the role. Playing Hamlet may or may not be every actor’s ambition. But playing a cartoon character is every actor’s dream.  Watching how much fun Emma Stone has with the title role in “Cruella” you can see why. Kohl-eyed and in command, she vamps, she camps, she stamps — and not just her foot. If Stone put any more spin on her line readings, she could audition to play a gyroscope.  She’s the best thing about “Cruella,” which is both playing in theaters and streaming on Disney+. You can hear the fun she’s having in her excellently throaty English accent. You can see it in how she gets to dress to the nines (dress to the tens, or even elevenses, would be more accurate). The audience has fun, too. Or as much fun as there is to be had with a movie so uneven in tone and intent. There are times when “Cruella” seems like a spinoff of “Joker” (2019) — another overlong, overproduced origin story set in the ‘70s about a much-put-upon character whom events transform into . . . well, Cruella isn’t as scary as the Joker (who is?), but this isn’t a movie for little ones.  Cruella was born Estella, and the movie begins with her being born. (This is an origin story that really originates.) The most famous Estella is in Dickens’s “Great Expectations,” and this Estella has a highly Dickensian youth. In 1964, she’s expelled from her private school. After a shocking event — again, this isn’t a movie for little kids — Estella escapes to London. She joins forces with a pair of amiable young pickpockets, Jasper and Horace, and “Great Expectations” hands the baton to “Oliver Twist.” The future Cruella has met her future henchmen.  Ten years pass, and Estella is now played by Stone, and Jasper and Horace by Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser (both good, but with less and less to do). Estella has developed a passion for couture. She goes to work for London’s leading designer, the Baroness, who becomes Estella’s mentor and nemesis and Something Else (capital letters? yes, capital letters). Playing the Baroness, Emma Thompson is non-stop over-the-top. She’s like Stone that way, only brittle around the edges. The Baroness arrives onscreen in Audrey Hepburn sunglasses, wears a succession of turbans, and generally behaves as if fashion is a contact sport.  This makes sense, in a London poised between glam and punk — and with Aline Brosh McKenna, who adapted “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006), working on the script. “Cruella” credits no fewer than five writers, and the many hands show in the many influences the movie gestures toward. Besides “Joker,” Dickens, and “Prada,” Roald Dahl can be detected (the blend of darkness and aspirational innocence); and the longer the movie lasts, the more it seems like leftover Tim Burton. Craig Gillespie (”I, Tonya,” 2017) directed.  “Cruella” really is all over the map. You even get to hear that all-over-ness on the soundtrack. It features, among others, Supertramp, the Zombies, Joe Tex, Nancy Sinatra, Nina Simone, the Doors, Suzi Quatro, Doris Day, the Clash, Judy Garland, J. Geils and . . . you get the idea. You also see it in various throwaway bits. Some are kind of great. Estella’s first day on the job is shot as an homage to the Copa tracking shot in “Goodfellas” (1990). Some are kind of silly. One of the Baroness’s assistants has Yves Saint Laurent’s hairstyle and glasses.  “From the very beginning I’ve always made a statement,” Cruella announces at the outset in voice-over. Very true, and the movie that bears her name makes statements of its own — a lot of them. It just can’t decide which ones matter. “Elegance is refusal,” Coco Chanel famously said. Excess is just the opposite.",CAA_Doc7_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Negative,Cruella
27,CAA_Doc8_Cruella,"How do you solve a problem like Cruella? It’s a question that’s been rolling around in my head ever since Disney announced a standalone live action film depicting the early days of 101 Dalmatians’ villain as a young fashion designer coming of age in 1970s London. More specifically, how do you make family-friendly entertainment sympathizing with someone who’s only stated purpose is to kidnap, murder, and skin puppies? The simple answer is...you just don’t. Cruella certainly winks at what we think we know about the character — make sure to stay for the end credits scene — but it also cops out of actually having to explain her later actions, implying that we may have been wrong about her all along. Basically, if you were coming to Cruella hoping to better understand the demonic persona immortalized by Glenn Close in the 1996 movie, you will likely come out confused.  In the Craig Gillespie-directed movie, Cruella’s real name is Estella (played by Tipper Seifert-Cleveland as a child and Emma Stone as an adult). Her mother gives her the nickname Cruella because of her rebellious ways. When she’s kicked out of school for raging against the machine, Estella and mom head to London to start a new life. On the way though, they stop at Hellman Hall, home to the infamous Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), fashion designer and all around terror, to ask for funds. It’s unclear at that point what the connection is between the two families (a later twist reveals it). What is important is that while her mother meets with the Baroness, Estella sneaks into the mansion, where she comes face to face with her first fashion show. It’s love at first sight — until a trio of vicious Dalmatians run her out of the building. Estella hides to escape them, and succeeds. But the dogs, having lost their prey, focus on a new one: her mother. They rush her, and she falls off a cliff to her death.  At this point, you’re probably thinking what I’m thinking, Ohhhhh, okayyy. Cruella just wants revenge against the animals that killed her mother. It’s a basic plot, but one that any Marvel fan has been conditioned to respond to: Misfit child loses a parent in a violent event they believe to be their fault, triggering a life dedicated to avenging them.  For a while, Cruella does appear to be going down that road. Estella travels to London, meets Jasper (played by Ziggy Gardner, then Joel Fry) and Horace (Joseph MacDonald, then Paul Walther-Hauser), joins their gang of petty thieves, and dreams of starting her own fashion house. A menial job at House of Liberty department store leads her to be noticed by the Baroness, and for a while, things are looking up. Until suddenly, Estella’s memory is triggered: She didn’t kill her mother — the Baroness, whose whistle called the dogs on her, is the one truly responsible. Thus, Cruella is born, a fashion rival bent on destroying everything the Baroness has built.  Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil in 1996 movie.  First order of business? Get Horace and Jasper to kidnap the Baroness’ three beloved Dalmatians, a move that certainly harkens back to 101 Dalmatians. But this is where things get a little muddled. Cruella does a bait and switch with the dog content. First of all, the movie establishes fairly early on that though Estella does blame the Dalmatians for killing her mother, she actually loves dogs. After all, her best friend is a kind stray named Buddy, and Horace’s pet chihuahua, Tink, is an integral part of the gang’s crime operation. But then there’s the grand showpiece, in which Cruella stages a guerilla fashion show to the tune of Iggy and the Stooges’ “I Want To Be Your Dog” (in a Disney movie...punk is dead), and appears in a coat that appears to be made entirely of Dalmatian fur. We, like the Baroness, are meant to believe that she killed the three pooches — terrible yes, but on brand. And I have to say, for a second, I admired Gillespie’s — not to mention writers Tony McNamara and Dana Fox —  guts. To have a Disney protagonist not only kill dogs, but gleefully wear them with such panache? Simply outrageous.  Thankfully for the dogs, but regretfully for the plot, Cruella reveals that the coat is made of synthetic fur. This makes her a more palatable character to root for, but it completely retcons the very premise of 101 Dalmatians. It’s all right there in her name! She’s a cruel devil with a single objective: Obtaining a fur coat made out of that black-and=white fur she so covets. But this is a Disney movie, and one has to root for the protagonist. Which begs a truly existential question: Can an antagonist ever really be the protagonist without losing what made them antagonizing?  Therein lies the weakness of origin stories: Often, what makes a character interesting is precisely the mystique surrounding their background. An example I think of often is Obi-Wan Kenobi mentioning “the Clone Wars” in Star Wars: A New Hope. It sounds mythical, part of a backstory that we can only guess at. That kind of allusion to a major event is an integral part of world-building; it drops the viewer in a place with its own histories and references. But when you actually see that conflict depicted in Attack of the Clones, it falls completely flat. Really...this? Likewise, Joker’s weakness was in trying to attribute motive to a character whose sole purpose is chaos. Some things do not need to be explained. (As I write this, Timothée Chalamet has just been cast in an origin story about Willy Wonka, to which I can only say, enough.) Still, as Disney found out with 2014’s Maleficient, villain IP is lucrative. The Angelina Jolie-starring movie centered around Sleeping Beauty's dreaded sorceress grossed $758 million world-wide, more than tripling its estimated $200 million budget.  But if you’re going to make an origin story, it should at the very least illuminate something about the character. By the end of the Cruella, we’ve gotten all the expected “origin story” moments: the dual-toned hair, the “did you know this is called a Devil?” car, the Roger (Kayvan Novack) and Anita Darling (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) cameos. But the thing that actually requires a Cruella De Vil in the first place — that is, the action that makes her relevant to the story — is absent.  This is all made even more confusing by the end credits scene, which shows Roger, formerly the Baroness’ lawyer, at his piano singing the initial bars of Cruella’s theme song  (""Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil. If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will...""). The doorbell rings, and a box containing a Dalmatian puppy named Pongo arrives on Roger’s doorstep. Likewise, Anita, who in this adaptation is a gossip journalist and Cruella’s childhood friend, receives a puppy called Perdita. Since Cruella kept the Baroness’ dogs, I can only surmise that these puppies are their offspring. But while this does effectively leave room for a sequel, it does nothing to explain why Cruella would later want to murder the children of the dogs she has just gifted to her friends! In fact, why even call this movie Cruella? One could easily envision a movie about an aspiring fashion designer, played by Stone, who spars with a turban-wearing Thompson. Most of Cruella does actually revolve around this dynamic, and you know what? Those scenes alone are worth the price of admission.  Does Cruella really explain how a woman was born brilliant, bad, and a little bit mad? Not really.  But if you’re looking to spend a little over two hours in a Devil Wears Prada-like dance between two quite fabulous Emmas, then step right up. This one’s for you.",CAA_Doc8_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Positive,Cruella
28,CAA_Doc9_Cruella,"Cruella De Vil is one of Disney's most iconic villains, but she doesn't always get the same love that the studio's other notorious baddies get. It feels like the villains of the late '80s and '90s — Ursula, Scar, Jafar, etc — get most of that glory. But now it's time to dig up a classic and make her great again, and Disney does just that in the live-action film ""Cruella.""  Most people probably have a solid understanding of what Cruella is all about. She's high fashion. Super snooty. And she really wants to make a coat out of poor, helpless Dalmatian puppies. She wasn't the most developed character in Disney history, but that's where director Craig Gillespie comes in. Behind him is a big team: the screenplay is by Dana Fox and Tony McNamara and the story by Aline Brosh McKenna, Kelly Marcel and Steve Zissis.  Together, they've teamed up to create an edgy and bold (yet still family-friendly) film that is definitely worth a watch . . .or two, or three.  Leading the ensemble in this cast is Academy Award winner Emma Stone. She's come a long way from her ""Easy A"" days, and this film proves she still has the acting chops to pull off perfect comedic moments as well as the more emotional, intimate scenes. (And yes, this movie really goes there when digging into Cruella's past.)  The film starts off with the titular character as a small child, then known as Estella. We see her suffer through a tragic event that leads her to living on the streets of London. She meets friends Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) along the way, and they spend their time running grifts and schemes on unsuspecting people just to get by. As a young adult, Estella never gives up her dreams of becoming a fashion designer. And when she runs into top fashionista Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson), Estella's world changes completely, for better or worse.  While Stone does an amazing job bringing Cruella to life, Thompson is just as good as the Baroness, who's posh, snooty, and completely self-absorbed — this is the woman who Cruella gets her inspiration from, mannerisms and all.  There are many other elements of Cruella's backstory that get filled in, although some of the questions it answers probably weren't on your mind unless you're a huge ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" fan. ""Why is she called Cruella De Vil?"" ""Why is her hair black and white?"" ""Why are Cruella and Anita so close?"" The film serves up clever answers to all of these.  The film features an excellent supporting cast. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser make the buffoon-like characters Jasper and Horace from the animated film so much more enjoyable. Both Kirby Howell-Baptiste and Kayvan Novak are endearing as Anita and Roger. And neither Mark Strong (John the valet) nor John McCrea (a spunky dress-shop keeper named Artie) are wasted.  Lastly, it's hard to talk about Cruella without mentioning the amazing hair, makeup and fashion that truly gives this movie its flair. Jenny Beavan led costume design for this film, and her looks for Cruella and the Baroness are surely Oscar-worthy. Nadia Stacey contributed to the hair and makeup design, giving Cruella in particular some amazingly bold looks. And we can't leave out Fiona Crombie's production design; the sets are stunning, including the ones for the multiple lavish party scenes.  With all those things combined, Cruella shines as quite possibly one of the strongest new-era live-action Disney films. You may want to watch ""One Hundred and One Dalmatians"" before watching the new film just so you're caught up on all the little Easter eggs that get dropped, but you can also come in with a clean slate knowing you're in for a good show regardless. There are plenty of hilarious scenes, good tunes, and lots of twists to keep you entertained the whole way through. So if you happen to want to see a fun Disney film that caters to both younger and older crowds, you won't want to miss ""Cruella.""",CAA_Doc9_Cruella,CAA,Comedy,Positive,Cruella
29,CAA_Doc10_Cruella,"There's an excellent Emma in ""Cruella,"" but it may not be the Emma you're thinking of.  Emma Stone is the lead; she plays the title role in a comedy that takes place before most of the events of Disney's classic, animated ""101 Dalmatians."" But the real star is Emma Thompson. She's Cruella De Vil's nemesis, a fashion designer in 1960s London whose nastiness makes Cruella look like a Nobel Peace Prize winner.  The movie, which is in theaters and on Disney Plus, takes awhile getting to either Emma. A 15-minute prologue spends too long filling us in on Cruella's youth, when she's played by kids we're never going to see again and aren't interested in. Things start to click when the adult Cruella, played by Stone, snags an apprenticeship at a design house ruled by the Baroness (Thompson), who announces to no one in particular, ""Gorgeous and vicious — it's my favorite combination.""  There's a little Miranda Priestly in the Baroness and there's more than a little ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in ""Cruella,"" which was cowritten by ""Prada"" screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna. Often, it's hard to say for whom the PG-13 movie was intended. That it comes from Disney and is a brand extension of a children's book/movie makes it appear to be for kids. But the subject matter — two women battle for control of London's fashion market — slides it closer to the ""Prada"" audience of stylish women and the gay men who love them.  Either way, it's the mean authority figure we care about, not the younger woman that we're supposed to love.  This isn't even Thompson's first ""Prada"" knockoff, as she also starred in Mindy Kaling's ""Late Night."" But this character is broader, funnier, more narcissistic and, because she doesn't even bother to hide her monstrousness behind a veneer of etiquette, more strangely lovable.  Thompson usually plays sensible people who don't care about fashion but she looks smashing here in gowns designed by two-time Oscar-winner Jenny Beavan, many of which frame her neck with architectural swoops of fabric. The Baroness is more openly contemptuous than Priestly was and much of her behavior is criminal. Thompson embraces her inner ogre so fully that she makes it great fun to watch the Baroness bark at an underling, ""I need you to stop talking, Roger, so I have a gap to fire you.""  As is often the case, the villain gets all the best lines. Give Stone credit for trying to break out of the nice roles she nearly always plays, but she's not a great fit for Cruella (I'm thinking Kristen Stewart? Florence Pugh?). She also looks great in the Beavan designs, particularly a ballgown with a parachute-like train that must be 30 feet long. But we never get a handle on Stone's Cruella. She is wishy-washy in a way that the character who inspired the line ""Whenever you see her, you start getting ill"" cannot be.  It's not entirely Stone's fault. In a sure sign there were script issues, six writers are credited and none can decide what to do with their main character. Since she's the protagonist, they seem to think she can't be as evil as she was in ""101 Dalmatians."" That forces them either to offer pop psychology explanations for why she broke bad, or to flip her back and forth from good to bad with no explanation (her treatment of minions Jasper and Horace is most puzzling, especially since Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are excellent in the roles).  Writing this screenplay wouldn't have been an easy assignment since it must make a legendary villain who hates puppies into a likable gal while also setting up a transition into the story told by the original ""101 Dalmatians"" (stick around through the credits for that).  The weird thing is there's a gifted screenwriter on board who seems ideal for pulling all those things together: Thompson, who won an Oscar for adapting Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility."" That screenplay was gorgeous and vicious, as well as romantic and sweet — my favorite combination.

30,AAT_Doc1_TheMatrixResurrecton,"Lately, I'm learning the hard way that Awesome Trailer equals Bad Movie! Wonder Woman 1984, Halloween Kills, Ghostbusters Afterlife (yeah, that movie sucked despite popular opinion), and now this film THE MATRIX RESURRECTIONS (2021)...all had cool trailers yet all are bad films. And what do most of these movies have in common? They are distant sequels to originally (and still) beloved movies. I was so ambivalent about even watching this new Matrix movie that, I kid you not, when I kept seeing the name ""Resurrections"" pop up, I thought it was one of the earlier sequels! They all sound the same to me...Reloaded, Revolutions Resurrection. Ten years from now...knock wood...I'll probably be confusing all these subtitles not being able to distinguish one from the other. The first Matrix from 1999 is a movie that never really intrigued me, not really watching it until years after it came out. The appeal was the eye-popping and original and unique CGI, which is one of the reasons I felt this new movie wasn't going to be good. In the last 20 years, almost everything feels like CGI, so the Matrix is now of victim of it's own originality. The MAIN thing that was good from the first film were the effects because I could barely remember anything about the characters. Something that's always been true of Hollywood is the hot actors of the time get the plum roles and in the 90s, Keanu Reeves was definitely a popular actor, despite his limited range as a thespian. Then when an international blockbuster like The Matrix surfaces, it basically gave him a career. He can always fall back on the Matrix when times get tough. And I've never been the biggest fan of any of the other main actors from the first film either. Carrie Ann Moss, Joe Pantaliano, and Laurence Fishburne are all serviceable Hollywood actors, but nothing special, in my opinion. Moss was basically a fashion model turned actress. Pantaliano made a career of playing himself in movies, regardless of genre. And Fishburne always seemed to be a bit yet irrelevant player in random classic movies over the years, never really leaving much of an impression. But with the possible exception of Moss, at least these actors can unequivocally say they are better at their craft than Reeves, an actor who always seemed to get outshined by his co-stars.The original Matrix might be the exception with Reeves, though, because that blank clueless expression he always brings to his roles suited that film perfectly. I guess you could compare it to Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Terminator, the difference being that as time goes on, Arnie's performance becomes more iconic and you can tell the dedication with which he played the part, while with Reeves, all of his ""good"" performances feel more like the product of luck and irony. Plus his zen, nice guy image in reality seems to make him popular among moviegoers. Reeves has never been one of my favorite actors, but at least with Reeves, most people KNOW his limitations and don't overrate him as a great actor like they do a lot of others. He's accepted for who he is, which is something. The Matrix movies are just like any other random set of movies for me and so it doesn't matter who the star of them is, I'm indifferent. Unlike other iconic films that started movie trends like Psycho, Jaws, and Saw, The Matrix just isn't a film worth re-visiting or analyzing for me. It's an overpraised cool 90s summer action movie that is regarded as a masterpiece. An example of a 90s film that actually holds up and gets better with time is Starship Troopers because it's more than just action and cool looking effects and it doesn't feel pretentious like The Matrix.",AAT_Doc1_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Negative,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
31,AAT_Doc2_TheMatrixResurrecton,"It's Intentionally Bad. Warner Bros had been pressuring the Wachowskis for more Matrix movies since 2003. Sometime around 2019 they made it apparent that they were going to go ahead with 'resurrecting' the franchise with or without the Wachowskis' input. They were threatening to hire a screenwriter best known for making Marvel super hero movies (and not the best installments of that unfortunate franchise either) who wanted to develop a Matrix ""expanded universe"". Lilly Wachowski still flatly refused to be involved in the farce. I can only guess that Lana reasoned that she wouldn't be able to simply wash her hands of the franchise. Just as the awful new Star Wars movies reflect on George Lucas even though he's no longer involved with them, a resurrected, never-ending, money grubbing zombie Matrix franchise would still reflect poorly on the Wachowskis. It may be WB's IP but it was the Wachowskis' creative work. So Lana hatched a bold plan - make a Matrix movie so bad and so unprofitable that WB will realize it's not worth trying to squeeze any more money out of the franchise and just let it rest in peace. One terrible movie is a black mark on the franchise, but hopefully the true fans will see it for what it is and disregard it, and it won't be nearly as bad as the zombified Matrix-themed MCU cash cow that may have resulted if Resurrections had been even moderately successful. The first act (40 minutes) of Resurrections isn't a massive mise en abyme - it's a not-so-subtle coded message that explains the motivation for the film. ""But look at this place. We did this, together. Now what? Things have changed, the market's tough. I'm sure you can understand why our beloved parent company, Warner Brothers, has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy."" ""What?"" ""They informed me they're going to do it with or without us."" ""I thought they couldn't do that."" ""Oh, they can, and they made it clear they'll kill our contract if we don't cooperate."" But what about the previous scene where Lana makes fun of Matrix fans, represented by the game developers, who think they understand the original trilogy by reducing it to trans politics, crypto anarchy, allegory for capitalist exploitation of the working class, or bullet time action sequences? Isn't this fourth-wall-breaking reference to WB just more fan bashing? I don't think it is. The original trilogy may not have been solely about any of those things, but they were all certainly themes, Lana isn't disavowing them. The dialogue concerning the mise en abyme, the original trilogy, is all genuine, I think the dialogue about the sequel is also genuine and meant to convey that we're about to be treated to a movie that Lana didn't really want to make. The movie proper is one big second act from minute 40 to the end. It's mostly fan service: you wanted fist fights, bullet stopping, hover ships? Well here you go, enjoy it. But there is some subtle messaging in there. Whereas the original trilogy was about human autonomy as a linchpin to some Gödelian ceiling the machines had reached in their existence (as well as trans politics, crypto anarchy, allegory for capitalist exploitation of the working class, and bullet time action sequences ;), Resurrections is about the Blue Pills, the people who want to stay in the Matrix. It's a critique of modern dependence on social media - we're inserting ourselves willingly. The dividing line between the Matrix and the 'real world' is no longer clear, hence the color palettes and character costumes in the two domains are now almost indistinguishable whereas they both served as a clear demarcation in the original trilogy. It's a critique on the modern managerial class who've transitioned from the suit & tie Agent oppressors to the always-casual-Friday, wants-to-be-your-buddy boss who's still the same old oppressor but in a new costume. There is a semblance of a good, meaningful story here, possibly an earlier script that involved people willingly returning to the Matrix en masse. But alas, the purpose of Resurrected wasn't to be good. What we get instead is lots of bland action sequences, poorly written dialogue, unremarkable effects and soundtrack, poor audio levels, forgettable characters, contrived character resurrections, and a",AAT_Doc2_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Negative,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
32,AAT_Doc3_TheMatrixResurrecton,"Embarrassing to watch. Hollywood is no longer capable of producing good movies. The true epitome of lazy film making. I was one of those Matrix fan loyalist who absolutely loved the hell out of the original trilogy and defended both the Enter the Matrix game and Animatrix despite pointless additions. I SO badly wanted this movie to be epic. I was eagerly anticipating Resurrections but for the life of me its abysmal.I really wanted to see Hollywood finish off 2021 with a strong offering, because the world is laughing at us, and they think we are all foolish and ignorant. Movies have been our greatest artistic and cultural offering to the world for nearly a century. In fact, our movies have changed the world. They have defined generations, and moments in time by capturing peoples' hearts and minds in every corner of the globe. In the back of my head I kept telling myself its not bad but after some time pondering about it I realised what a poor excuse of a film this was. Sadly, just like this movie itself, Hollywood has lost the plot. We have praised actors like Keanu Reeves, but like many other legacy actors, he plays the exact same role in every movie. You could easily take scenes from all the Matrix, John Wick, and most of his other movies, and randomly string them together, and it would seem like one long movie. While I applaud some of the awesome things he has done with action movies, like learning how to fight and shoot very accurately, it doesn't make up for the fact that he just keeps playing the same character over and over. I have so many issues with this movie. First off, I had to stop it 4 or 5 times to get up and take a break from it. They tried too hard to make it feel new and that time has passed... literally there must be 25 to 30 references on how time has passed and how things are different now. This movie is like a mockery of itself. I don't know what these people were smoking when they wrote this script, but it must be strong stuff. (I'm pretty sure we are aware that time has passed, guys. We are not toddlers. We get it. Time has passed since the last ''battle''. Can we move on, and get a grip please? Thanks.) The cold and dark grayish and green hues in the production was visually appealing and brought me back to the vibes of the classic first Matrix.... and that's the only reason I am even giving it 2 stars, because other than that, this production was shocking - shockingly terrible. The visual effects have actually DEGRADED. What is going on in Hollywood? If we can't even get the visuals right with a huge budget, and an ungodly assortment of movie studios in Los Angeles, and the best of the best of everything at our fingertips, what are we good for? Have they not seen the STUNNING visual effects coming out of Russia lately? Yes, RUSSIA. If the Russians are putting out better CGI effects than Hollywood, I ask, what in the hell are they doing in Hollywood? Too busy pushing the propaganda and hiding in the shadows and being terrified of getting the sniffles and a cough? I could type for hours about this movie, but it's not worth my time. Very sad.

33,AAT_Doc4_TheMatrixResurrecton,"I actually enjoyed this film the first time I saw it, but then I saw it a second time after listening to all the comments about how brilliant this film must be and how we must all worship it. I've never walked out on a film before, and that even includes Battlefield Earth and Wing Commander, but I walked out in the middle of trying to watch this one again. I've never seen a film that people try so hard to make out to be so much more than it really is. The worst part is the obssessive cult that has formed up around the film, telling us how great and visionary the directors are and how we should all worship them and blah blah blah. Well gang, like the Region Coding Enhancement scheme, time and people's patience is going to catch up with this dreary film, and the results are going to leave the makers very red-faced. Just about every concept in this film is stolen, poorly executed, or both. I still laugh my guts out when Morpheus tries to tell us how human bodies produce so much energy when they consume at least that much in a day. Any nutritionist worth their salt could tell you that. The division of a digital future between evil robots and kind-hearted human beings was also done far better in Tron. And the sloppy use of the Christ Theme as a plot device doesn't even bear thinking about. When I first saw the film, I had never laughed so hard in my life. When I saw it on DVD, I'd never felt so insulted. Never have I seen a production crew with such over-inflated ideas about their achievements. The characters are just plain boring, too. Keanu Reeves has all the acting ability of a stuffed toy, and yet he is the most interesting thing in the film. That's a worrying sign. Morpheus was all poses and zero credibility, Agent Smith was just an insult, and Trinity had to be one of the least watchable romantic interests since Teri Hatcher's awful performance in Tomorrow Never Dies. And was this film trying hard for some kind of record in speaking ****? Well, guess what? Their efforts succeeded big-time. Every man and his dog seems to be going on about how much better this film was than the last episode of Star Wars, but it is really more on a level with Star Trek. Childish fantasy unrelieved by decent acting or directing, with a script which could not have passed muster in a first-year writing class, marred by special effects which range from silly and overblown to silly, overblown, and pointless. Frankly, if this is the future of science fiction films, then I will happily stick with my copy of Plan 9 From Outer Space. At least Ed Wood had sincere intentions of a variety other than ripping off an army of suckers when he made that piece of ****! Zero stars.

34,AAT_Doc5_TheMatrixResurrecton,"I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix. For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen. ""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day. The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts. I didn't like this movie. I love Sci-Fi, this film is stupid. The main character lacks on, the action isn't so great, and I've heard the sequels sucked. So, no go for this. It wasn't really R rated material from what I remember. Not ultra violent like Quintin Taliento but probably soft R. Still, not my cup of tea.I didn't enjoy this movie. They wasted money to bring you great special effects and put them in with a bad plot and bad movie. Special Effects were good, I'll give it that. But what was the point? Where was the plot? And another thing, I don't like Keanau Reeves. He cannot act...at all. And how did Laurence Fishborne end up in a bad movie. He's a great actor. This was just a waste of his talent.",AAT_Doc5_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Negative,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
35,AAT_Doc6_TheMatrixResurrecton,"Brilliant return to form. Like all movies, this one too works on an emotional level, and your willingness to relate to the characters in the film and their cinematic treatment. For me, this is a standout Keanu Reeves performance. He's vulnerable, unsure, uncertain, and so likeable. I found myself looking at him again and again, and really seeing an older version of Neo, and that happened instantaneously for me. It also helped that I really liked the snappy visual language of the film, superb lighting, great editing, and fabulous action choreography. Hollywood filmmaking skill in all its glory - so many many pieces coming together. That said, this film is bathed in a sort of nostalgia about Matrix 1999, and it is an earnest paean to the first film, and keeps referring to it, and its reception and follow up in a very literal way. So unless you're interested in delving into Matrix I, and what followed it, and what audiences expected, I think a lot of Matrix Resurrections will be strange and unintelligible. So I'm not sure that it works as a standalone action movie! Hard for someone like me to know, since I'm a pretty avid Matrix I fan. I liked all of the performances in the film. Perhaps the one that left me feeling a bit cold was Carrie-Anne Moss', which surprisingly didn't really work for me. I found her a bit remote, aloof, and disconnected. Unlike in the earlier films, where she consistently delivered emotion and poignance. So perhaps with a stronger performance from her, the film would have worked better. That is my only real critique. Technically, I loved this rendition. I loved the costumes, the music, the lighting, the editing. Even the CG was pretty decent (although not great, still a bit heavy-handed, like Matrix II and III). For me, the transition to the machine world was always the weakest part of the earlier trilogy, it just didn't feel as real as the depiction of the matrix (with a lower case, the simulation that the machines have made for humans) itself was - as in, the first film spent the most time in the matrix itself, and I loved that, but wasn't a big fan of the real world depiction. Still holds true with Resurrections, I still don't really like the real world they've built. I always felt that the aesthetic and dramatic differences between the matrix (with its stylish visuals, the underground rave vibe, a sort of chic 60s vibe) and the real world (earth tones, a subterranean world, huge amounts of CG and relatively little modern cultural or historical anchoring) made for an uncomfortable mix within the same movie, and that's still somewhat true here for me. But Resurrections worked for me. I loved how they slowed things down, had a polished and intelligible script with no obvious flaws, spent time with each character and didn't descend into needless orgies of action. Even though there are plenty of those, there's still dramatic reasoning through it all, at least for me. As a Matrix fan, I really enjoyed this film.",AAT_Doc6_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Positive,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
36,AAT_Doc7_TheMatrixResurrecton,"Don't hate what you love. It's been a while since I wrote a review but I think this movie deserves a balanced review, but also I want to explain those who haven't watched Matrix Resurrections why it is receiving so much hate and why it deserves a chance. The first reason is the most basic one: expectations. The original Matrix is almost IMPOSSIBLE to overcome. You can make a better movie of course, but not a better Matrix movie for one reason: the premise was so ingenious and new that blew everyones' heads. It also came out at a time where technology was not being used at its full potential and the Wachowskis came up with an extremely original concept such as bullet time. All those things are one in a lifetime breakthroughs and anything that follow-up with inherently be lesser. That being said, all the three sequels have been in my opinion more flawed that they could have been but definitely not bad movies, so I have to step up when I see the last installment is being treated as an Adam Sandler bad film. Matrix Resurrections is underneath all its flaws a very original movie, one that takes the source material and the lore very seriously and takes to the next level organically and ingeniously. The concepts, the new elements, the mythology are definitely canon and expand the Matrix universe in very interesting directions. The philosophy feels updated and more relevant to our current world than the first Matrix. Back then, being part of the system was the thing of materialistic and conformist sheeps. Red pills were for the rebels, the anarchist, those who dared challenging the status quo and imagine a world without boundaries and bondage. In 2021, the red-pillers are weirdos, conspiracy theorist and bigots who equally distrust science, politics, institutions and media but funily enough, trust religion, social networks and capitalism... Well, this is what Matrix Resurrections deal with; Projects the matrix cosmogony to a world where the machines already learned how to manipulate those who know what the matrix is and even those who woke up and supposedly disconnected already. Achieving this is not a small feat in and of itself makes this movie deserving of not only a watch but the same analysis that its predecessors called for. Now, of course there are a lot of flaws in the execution, the one closer to my heart is the poor fight coreographies. Every time I saw them (except a very short one) I feel what you feel when you see your old dad trying to pull the same physic trick he did when you were a kid. Nothing to do with the protagonists age, but the terrible miss of a good coreographer. Special effects are very decent but none of them is outstanding and some elements and characters seem out of place or purposeless, but there is plently of new stuff and fun to grant this one at least a solid 7. I'm giving it 10 just to help balance the injustice.",AAT_Doc7_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Positive,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
37,AAT_Doc8_TheMatrixResurrecton,"10/10An artist forced to destroy their masterpiece in order to save it. WB wanted a cash grab, Lana delivers us this urgent message. We pride the first Matrix on making us think long after viewing the movie. I was so disappointed in this movie*, and all I could think of was what went wrong, so it was at least within the same spirit. I took it upon my self to try and find out. My theory.The first portion of the movie explains everything, and it's not even veiled. Lana name dropped Warner Brothers, which came as a bit of a 'shock' to hear, which was exactly it's intention. In this moment Lana has effectively removed you from the movie*. This is done in order to speak to you in person. She had the following message, ""WARNER BROTHERS said they would do it without us...~"" Take note, the way in which this sentence is worded the 'shock' is delivered first. In this portion of the movie Lana is Neo (actually she's always Neo). Neo expresses how there's no story to be told, because after the trilogy, the story was complete, but when you're in that position you feel as though your Art, your Passion is being threatened, so you might as well take the reigns. I apologize beforehand if I'm wrong, but I really believe the cat went up this tree. I honestly feel that this movie was intentionally sabotaged, or just not really taken that seriously. I say that because if we're still assuming that Lana is Neo, and Neo feels as though there's no need for a Matrix 4. Yet he still has to make it anyway for some big corporation that wants cash grab (before the year's end). When art pieces are as personal as The Matrix is to the Wachowski's it can be rather insulting when someone bypasses all the meaning behind it just to make a quick buck. So after Lana uses the first act of the movie* to explain to you why the Matrix 4 doesn't need to exist, and the remaining acts she just eked out something that resembled a movie just to get it past those corporate morons (and it worked). All Within the first act Lana's statement is complete. You can turn the movie* off, because what follows is Lana demonstrating what happens when you don't respect the work of an artist.The fact that Lawrence Fishburne wasn't even contacted, and the decision to move forward without Hugo Weaving actually makes sense now. It was actually done out of respect for the two veteran actors.I believe Lana knew that this movie* would tank, If the movie didn't tank they'd just ask for another, and another, yet the story was already completed. Having the movie tank works in her favor, to lower the value of the franchise so that it would be less likely to be looked at in such a disgustingly greedy way. However I don't know how effect that will be, WB always has the option to, ""do it without us (Wachowskis),"" and perhaps a spinoff might save the franchise, but a franchise isn't what Lana wants",AAT_Doc8_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Positive,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
38,AAT_Doc9_TheMatrixResurrecton,"To the audience who are willing to comprehend The Matrix movies. As the heading goes.. this movie is only for those who are willing to put some effort to comprehend what they see. Others.. who see The Matrix for its flashy costumes or the action..well for those there is a sleuth of movies belonging to the genre which included Pacific Rim or The Transformers or even the good old Shaolin Soccer. To such viewers I just have one thing to say.. when you come to eat the sandwich biscuits with cream.. you can lick of the cream sure.. but a tad more effort is needed to eat the biscuits. If you just wanted the cream and weren't willing to put the effort to eat the biscuit.. well why not settle for a custard. The Matrix Resurrections is a an excellent wholesome meal and movie making at its best. So please.. it does deserve some effort if it is to entertain you because the effort that you the viewer puts in .. is part of the effort. All this is to all those viewers who were quick to judge the movie for its reduced action sequences and redundant displays of scenes from its prequels.. Please people.. think again. Or at the very least please have the decency to tone down your criticisms.. it's been quite a tragedy to see such a marvel of a movie being trashed simply because it doesn't fit into the general convention of a Sci-Fi or a thriller or an action movie.. honestly.. this is the Wachowskis who gave you The Matrix (1999) the Reloaded and Revolutions. And of course.. the series Sense8. Of course these are all creations which require you to ruminate and ponder upon and not just another watch and entertain package. Now to the audience who are willing to put the effort.. people this is a movie which will not let you down. Certainly it would make you want to go back to it again because it's a lot of thinking concentrated to 150 minutes and it certainly does put up a spurt of speed halfway through without warning.. just when one would think that the movie was beginning to seem like fan fiction. As a person in whom The concept of the Matrix has evoked introspection.. I must say.. this is such a great gift of a movie. Because it answers as to how he humans progressed after the Machine War ends in The Matrix Revolutions. Zion was portrayed as the abode of humans ... the literal haven of the 'good' humans while the Earth's crust had been 'snatched' away by the villainous machine intelligence. But then the same Matrix also had Oracle and Sati which conveyed that true intelligence comprehends the fallacy that is dichotomous beliefs or morales. Simply put, the foolishness of trying to fit what is created into the framework of good and bad. It's cooperation and balance which sustains while anything else would look utopic in short sight but certainly would not be sustainable. So yes.. how did the humans fare after the war and how did the machines fare.. this forms the premise of the movie. And certainly a gem has been created once again. The Matrix (1999) presented the idea while reloaded and revolutions took it forward. To one who paid attention it would be clear that.. as the sequels progressed.. it was more and more of insights into the mind of humans and machines and clearly underneath the difference there was a lot of common ground for both since both minds are seats of true intelligence. The idea of individuality, of disobedience, of being the misshapen peg in the geometric hole.. is personified in all the humans who woke up out of the matrix and also in Smith.. the agent. In short.. this is moviemaking and storytelling at its best. So really to those of you who are willing to pay attention and aren't fond of only mindless pleasure.. this is a movie for You. It is certainly not for everybody. It would be great if this was realised by the general audience.. when it is being unduly harsh on a masterpiece which certainly deserves a much much better reception.",AAT_Doc9_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Positive,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
39,AAT_Doc10_TheMatrixResurrecton,"Perhaps The Greatest ""Meta"" Film Ever Constructed. I absolutely loved especially in IMAX worth the wait I would not have wanted to see streaming on HBO that would've been not as good. I convinced my mom to see all 3 originals to see this and she loved it too we both think it's a 10! An exhilarating fun popcorn film with lots of epicness, beautiful cinematography, my favorite aspect symbolism/metaphors and humor. The Matrix 1 is among one of my favorites and to me this is one of the best sequels by Lana Wachochski she did perfect with her visionary style that is mind blowing mastery! Warning: Spoilers :Bringing the Matrix universe back to the big screen after an 18-year absence was always going to be a daunting task. A pure screenwriter might recommend an entirely new approach to the subject matter, but that is not-for the most part-what transpires here. No, The Matrix Resurrections actually doubles down on its own intellectual property, if you will. While seemingly a recipe for disaster, Warner Brothers & director Lana Wachowski construct a near-masterwork of meta self-reference and mystery.For a very basic overview, Resurrections opens in a familiar fashion to Matrix fans: a latex-clad woman (Jessica Henwick) being pursued by suited Agents. Is this a straight re-hash of the original's first scenes-or something more/different? Then, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is introduced as a struggling programmer who once created a wildly successful trilogy of Matrix video games. He meets/observes a woman (Carrie Anne Moss) at a local coffee shop who makes him think/look twice and begins questioning the nature of his reality-a process that continues when he is visited by a figure claiming himself Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II). Just what in the heck is going on here?!It is easy to look at Matrix Resurrections and write it off as WB touting its own IP or catering to nostalgia for the '99 original. Seeing as how the studio behemoth did the same thing with the new Space Jam, I get it. But this isn't Space Jam-not by a mile. Here, the meta-references to the original trilogy are inherent to the plot and serve to create an insatiable mystery that in many ways very much mirrors the intrigue of that mind-blowing original.What Resurrections really gets right is its ability to make the viewer legitimately question everything about their conceptions of the original trilogy. Did those events really happen? Was it all just a simulation of its own? Is what we are seeing now even ""real""? This is extremely difficult to pull off successfully, so I have to give kudos to Wachowski, who also shares writing credit with David Mitchell & Aleksandar Hemon. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that Resurrections could capture even a sampling of the turn-of-the-millennium magic from The Matrix, but it does. I can say with no reservations that I was enraptured and mentally/emotionally engaged from beginning to end. Is Resurrections a perfect sequel? Not quite. Neil Patrick Harris plays a crucial role that let me down a bit, as does Jonathan Groff's character. The movie also cannot innovate visually the way the franchise once did, so the action sequences take somewhat of a back seat here (again, though, largely in service to the meta-narrative.",AAT_Doc10_TheMatrixResurrecton,AAT,Sci_Fi,Positive,The_Matrix_Resurrecton
40,BARRYC_Doc1_GroundhogDay,"Imagine waking up to your least favorite day of the year again... and again... and again. This is the problem plaguing Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, a well-intentioned but slow romantic comedy whose main gimmick grows real tiresome really fast. Murray plays Phil Connors, an arrogant big-city TV weatherman who dreads his annual assignment of covering a Groundhog Day festival in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil hopes to do his report and leave Punxsutawney as quickly as possible, but an unexpected blizzard strands him there for the night. But Phil's hopes of leaving the next day are dashed when--due to circumstances never clearly explained--he finds himself trapped in Groundhog Day, waking up to the strains of ""I Got You Babe"" and experiencing the delirious joy of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Day festival over and over again. Phil decides to toy with the possibilities, robbing a bank, jumping off of a building, and ceaselessly trying to woo his producer (Andie MacDowell) until he gets it right. As always, Murray's natural comic presence and timing keep things interesting and amusing, and he has believable romantic chemistry with the appealing MacDowell. If only Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis's screenplay was as good as he. The central gimmick of the day repeating over and over again becomes old after the first five repetitions. The comic possibilities of a man held prisoner in his least favorite day are great, but the gag can only be taken so far. Watching the same situations arise ten to fifteen times is like watching a thirty-minute film stretched out to 100 minutes by repeatedly hitting a rewind button. Not helping matters is the sluggish direction by Ramis (Ghostbusters). Part of the reason why the main concept grows so monotonous is that Ramis doesn't inject any new energy to each variation of the same scene. This could have been an intentional stylistic method to depict Phil's boredom with the day (if it is, it works), but just because the situation is supposed to only bore the character does not mean it doesn't bore the audience as well; I don't know of anyone who finds amusement out of another person's boredom. Because of the delightful presence of Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a marginal success, but it could have been a complete one if the people behind the camera did as good a job as those in front of it. Perhaps it's dated, but I just don't think this movie is that funny. Not sure if this was entertaining at the time, now just good enough as background noice. Bill murray, so annoying.....although he did have a decent plan going on.... ADD and a plot that repeats over and over are not conducive. It was somewhat confusing... Groundhog Day, it's a movie we watched in film appreciation class. I personally think movies should contain certain theme and messages that we can observe. However, this movie's theme is not clear for me, and do not know what messages the director wants to give to the audiences. There were some few laughing points that entertained me, but it was more like a B class comedy film. Ending was not creative at all. Very nice and fun story, like most of these types of movies, but ending was not creative at all. basically you can predict the ending after first 15minutes, expected a better ending and a logical explaination. What's the hype about? Not sure what all the hype is about with this movie. I couldn't even stay awake for the whole thing. mmmm..... I knew all about the film, had heard about it, just never actually watched it. The main message of the film? To impress a woman you need to literally move the earth. super.

41,BARRYC_Doc2_GroundhogDay,"I Hate Groundhog Day. Here’s what’s on my mind: Groundhog Day. Now don’t worry, I don’t mean the fuzzy varmint. And I don’t mean more winter or more spring or anything like that. What I am here to talk about though is Groundhog Day, the movie. The one with Bill Murray. Most of us have seen it, probably all of us have seen it. It’s almost hard not to. I flipped through the channels the other day, and it was on four different channels, and actually the fifth in Spanish. So I ended up on an English channel, and ended up watching it. Did you know that’s on almost as much as Patrick Swayze in Roadhouse and The Shawshank Redemption? Holy cow! Anyway... One thing occurred to me while watching it is the anxiety of what Bill Murray is going through. Same thing day in, day out, no change, nothing different, over and over and over - that would drive anybody crazy, wouldn’t it? It obviously drove Bill Murray crazy. Now don’t get me wrong, I love discipline, and I love consistency, but blind repetition is just nuts, right? So when you think about your exhibit program, do you ever think that maybe it’s a little bit closer to Groundhog Day, or maybe Bill Murray’s character? Does it ever remind you of that? Very often we hear, ""We’re going to do the same thing, same people, same exhibit, same engagement, same thing - we’ve been doing it for years."" Hey, you know what? If that works, great! However, what about some measurable improvement? If you’re not going to change anything, you’re gonna just get what you get - each and every time. How do we do something slightly different? Even in the movie, Bill Murray improved himself throughout the movie. At one point he was taking piano lessons, he got better and better and better. I think he was even into ice sculpting, and if I’m not mistaken, he even spoke French because he got better and better. What could you be doing better? How do we get more leads? How do we get more people to stop? How do we have more meaningful engagements? How do we even maybe save money, things like that? Somebody once said, and I don’t know who said this, ""The price of doing the same old thing is a lot higher than the price of change."" I agree with that - you’ve got to do something different. Here’s an idea. Get your team together, but think of your team as this - get one person from the executive team, one from marketing, one from sales (you might fit one of those). But get together just once a month for fifteen, twenty minutes. Start talking about ideas, about what you could be doing different at each of your events. It’s not a huge investment in time, and we all know that you have your regular jobs, and this is probably lopped on to forty-eight other things you have to get done that week, right? But take fifteen, twenty minutes, and make sure you get different points of view from different people. Call it your R & D Events Team, right? And... if you need somebody else to bounce things off of, give us a call here at Nimlok Minnesota. Myself or anybody here would absolutely love to talk to you. That’s what was on my mind today. Let us know how we can help. Thanks!",BARRYC_Doc2_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Negative,Groundhog_Day
42,BARRYC_Doc3_GroundhogDay,"Before I watched this movie, I googled it (to find out the runtime) and saw an article entitled Here's Why Groundhog Day Is The Greatest Movie Ever Made (which I can't even read because it's not available in Europe), so needless to say my expectations were far too high when going into this. And maybe that's why I felt a bit...well, disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike Groundhog Day. In fact, I liked it. The concept is fun, Bill Murray plays the part well, and there are some very funny moments. But even despite all that, it just felt a bit forgettable. I wish I could explain it a bit better because it's considered a very iconic movie so I guess my opinion is a pretty unpopular one but I can't put my finger on it. I just felt that there was something missing, but I don't know what. You know, maybe it was the ending. Afterwards my mum (who hadn't been watching) asked me why the next day finally happened, and I couldn't answer. Was it because he got the girl? Or because he started thinking of others? Or, one step further, because he practically devoted his life to helping others? I've been comparing it to other similar films (guy re-evaluates life due to weird spiritual experience) - It's A Wonderful Life, Bruce Almighty, 17 Again - and all of them have a moment where the character realises how and why they need to change. But I never saw that in Groundhog Day, it just sort of...happened. And that's why I couldn't exactly answer my mum's question. But I guess leaving it up to interpretation is cool too, it's a different kind of ending. Onto some things I liked. First, Bill Murray - who, by the way, looks like Billy Joel in sunglasses: compare and contrast. He was great in this, and I don't think anyone could have played that part any better. I really liked the concept as well. I thought I'd get bored of it, but it remained interesting throughout, and I didn't even get sick of the song! It also leads you to wonder...what would you do with your Groundhog Day? I feel like I'd do a lot more celebrity stalking, to be honest. Nip on a train, blag my way into a film studio or a famous nightclub, something like that. However, this article calculates that Phil spends 33 YEARS in Groundhog Day. What?!?! I had no idea it was that long, but the maths is pretty compelling. It's actually a terrifying thought...imagine simultaneously losing and gaining over three decades of your life! So yeah. I'd definitely recommend watching it and can see why it's become a classic, but I honestly can't agree with several reviews calling it 'the best romcom of all time' and stuff like that. That's just my opinion though! What are your thoughts? I liked it in the past but I just couldn't get into it in 2021. I don't think it has aged very well. It's a lot slower than I remembered.",BARRYC_Doc3_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Negative,Groundhog_Day
43,BARRYC_Doc4_GroundhogDay,"Cheap laughs and over-sentimentality wrapped up in an interesting concept Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience. Though in the surface a good vehicle for Bill Murray, the cons outweigh the pros. There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world? The only possible solution to this, considering no one else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory. So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see. So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world. And each Phil goes onto the next day with everyone else in the world. So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more. So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd? The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him. In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives. So what could account for Phil? Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours. The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish. The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory. Now, much of the dialogue is strictly cheap laughs (""ever had Deja Vu?"" ""I'll see if it's on the menu"" and such). But as far as any overall message it gets lost in over-sentimentality, especially at the end. The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use tricks to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell). The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes the tricks as to impress her beyond belief. Remember that close to t helast night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last ""perfect"" day. On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so. So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want. If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a great film. As it is it a mediocre comedy with a twist.",BARRYC_Doc4_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Negative,Groundhog_Day
44,BARRYC_Doc5_GroundhogDay,"In Groundhog Day, legendary comedian Bill Murray plays Phil, a meteorologist who is sent every year to Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. This event is something Phil can't stand. He's ready to leave, but a blizzard strands him, and by the next morning, he finds that he's living Groundhog Day over and over and over again. He then proceeds to do whatever he wants. Andie MacDowell stars as Phil's producer Rita, Chris Elliot plays cameraman Larry, Stephen Tobolowsky plays Ned, an annoying high school friend of Phil who is now an insurance salesman, Brian Doyle-Murray plays the town mayor, and director Harold Ramis cameos as the town doctor. When I first heard that there was to be a film about someone living the same day over and over again, I thought it was the stupidest idea ever. But with Bill Murray in the lead, I figured it can't be that bad. Watching the film, I realized that Bill Murray is a talented comedian and is pretty funny in the role. There is also some good comedy, with the best scenes being Murray's suicide attempts, such as electrocution by toaster oven, driving off a cliff, running himself over, and jumping off a building. What's wrong with Groundhog Day, if there's good comedy? Well, there's just not a lot of comedy in this. In the second half of the film, Phil uses his repeated days to attempt to fall in love with his female producer. While many view these scenes as touching, I view them as boring, wishing that the comedy would return again. I liked MacDowell in her role, but during the romantic scenes with Bill Murray, their chemistry is off, heavily. Also, I had no idea where the film was heading. It was advertised as a comedy, but the film turns from comedy to romantic drama, which didn't make much since if it was advertised as a comedy. When I want comedy, I want comedy, not a melodrama. So in the end, while Groundhog Day has some decent comedy, it's overuse of melodrama weakens the film as a whole. Honestly, I thought that the story was done much better, and funnier, in a Donald Duck cartoon. Directed by Harold Ramis, Groundhog Day follows weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) as he finds himself forced to live through the eponymous day over and over again. There's little doubt that Groundhog Day benefits a great deal from Murray's appealing turn as the central character, as the actor's sarcastic, sardonic presence often elevates even the most minor of sequences - with the affable vibe heightened by the early inclusion of several irresistibly comedic segments (including an engaging stretch detailing Phil's efforts at bedding a pretty local). It's equally clear, however, that the movie suffers from a palpably listless feel that grows more and more problematic as time progresses, with the growing emphasis on a burgeoning romance between Phil and his attractive producer (Andie MacDowell's Rita) certainly exacerbating Groundhog Day's increasingly less-than-engrossing atmosphere. (The total lack of chemistry between Murray and MacDowell's respective characters ensures that their scenes together lack the romantic spark that Ramis has surely intended.) The intentionally repetitive nature of the film's premise paves the way for a second half that's almost entirely lacking in momentum, which ultimately prevents the viewer from wholeheartedly embracing the feel-good conclusion (ie it's an awfully tough slog getting to that point). It's ultimately difficult to comprehend why Groundhog Day has become something of a modern classic in the years since its 1993 release, with the film's forgettable, padded-out nature confirming its place as a promising yet disposable high-concept comedy.",BARRYC_Doc5_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Negative,Groundhog_Day
45,BARRYC_Doc6_GroundhogDay,"""Groundhog Day"" is a film that finds its note and purpose so precisely that its genius may not be immediately noticeable. It unfolds so inevitably, is so entertaining, so apparently effortless, that you have to stand back and slap yourself before you see how good it really is. Certainly I underrated it in my original review; I enjoyed it so easily that I was seduced into cheerful moderation. But there are a few films, and this is one of them, that burrow into our memories and become reference points. When you find yourself needing the phrase This is like ""Groundhog Day"" to explain how you feel, a movie has accomplished something. The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. He begins to learn. This man is named Phil, and he is a weatherman. In a sense, he feels himself condemned to repeating the same day, anyway; the weather changes, but his on-camera shtick remains the same, and he is distant and ironic about his job. Every year on Feb. 2 he is dispatched to Punxsutawney, Pa., to cover the festivities of Groundhog Day, on which Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, is awakened from his slumbers and studied to discover if he will see his shadow. If he does, we will have another six weeks of winter. We usually have another six weeks of winter, anyway, a fact along with many others that does not escape Phil as he signals his cynicism about this transcendentally silly event. Phil is played by Bill Murray, and Murray is indispensable; before he makes the film wonderful, he does a more difficult thing, which is to make it bearable. I can imagine a long list of actors, whose names I will charitably suppress, who could appear in this material and render it simpering, or inane. The screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis is inspired, but inspired crucially because they saw Bill Murray in it. They understood how he would be able to transform it into something sublime, while another actor might reduce it to a cloying parable. Ramis and Murray had worked together from the dawn of their careers, at Second City in Chicago, and knew each other in the ways only improvisational actors can know each other, finding their limits and strengths in nightly risks before a volatile and boozy audience. I doubt if Ramis would have had the slightest interest in directing this material with anyone else but Murray. It wasn't the story that appealed to him, but the thought of Murray in it. The Murray persona has become familiar without becoming tiring: The world is too much with him, he is a little smarter than everyone else, he has a detached melancholy, he is deeply suspicious of joy, he sees sincerity as a weapon that can be used against him, and yet he conceals emotional needs. He is Hamlet in a sitcom world. ""Lost in Translation,"" another film that works because Bill Murray is in it, captures these qualities. So does ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" which doesn't work because Murray's character has nothing to push against in a world that is as detached as he is. In ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), notice how easily he reveals that Phil (the weatherman, not the groundhog) is a perfect bastard. He doesn't raise his voice or signal through energetic acting that he's an insufferable jerk. He just is. He draws for his Punxsutawney assignment a patient angel of a producer named Rita (Andie MacDowell) and a good sport of a cameraman named Larry (Chris Elliott). Like television production people everywhere, they're accustomed to ""talent"" that treats them shabbily; they indulge the egos of the on-camera performers and get on with their jobs, reflecting perhaps that they can do without the big bucks if it means being a creep like Phil. At 6 a.m. on Feb. 2, Phil is awakened by the clock alarm in his cozy little Punxsutawney bed-and-breakfast. It is playing ""I Got You Babe,"" by Sonny and Cher. He goes through a series of experiences: Being greeted by an old classmate who wants to sell him insurance, stepping into an icy puddle, performing a stand-up on camera in front of the wretched groundhog, which he considers, not without reason, to be rat-like. Phil is rude to Rita and Larry, and insulting to his viewers (by implying they are idiots to be watching the segment). He has no liking for himself, his job, his colleagues or the human race. All he wants to do is get out of town. He begins to. He doesn't quite make it. What with one thing and another, he wakes up the next morning in the same bed, with the radio playing the same song, and it gradually becomes clear to him that he is reliving precisely the same day. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, in his case, doesn't creep in at its petty pace from day to day, but gets stuck like a broken record. After the third or fourth day, the enormity of his predicament is forced upon him. He is free to change what he says and does from one Feb. 2 to the next, but it will always be Feb. 2 for everyone else in the world, and he will always start from the same place. They will repeat themselves unless he changes the script, but tomorrow they will have forgotten their new lines and be back to the first draft of Feb. 2. One night in a bowling alley, sitting at the bar, he says almost to himself: ""What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and everything that you did was the same, and nothing mattered?"" The sad sack next to him at the bar overhears him and answers: ""That about sums it up for me."" Slowly, inexpertly, Phil begins to learn from his trial runs through Feb. 2. Ramis and Rubin in an early draft had him living through 10,000 cycles, and Ramis calculates that in the current version he goes through about 40. During that time, Phil learns to really see himself for the first time, and to see Rita, and to learn that he loves her, and to strive to deserve her love. He astonishingly wants to become a good man. His journey has become a parable for our materialistic age; it embodies a view of human growth that, at its heart, reflects the same spiritual view of existence Murray explored in his very personal project ""The Razor's Edge."" He is bound to the wheel of time, and destined to revolve until he earns his promotion to the next level. A long article in the British newspaper the Independent says ""Groundhog Day"" is ""hailed by religious leaders as the most spiritual film of all time."" Perhaps not all religious leaders have seen anything by Bergman, Bresson, Ozu and Dreyer, but never mind: They have a point, even about a film where the deepest theological observation is, ""Maybe God has just been around a long time and knows everything."" What amazes me about the movie is that Murray and Ramis get away with it. They never lose their nerve. Phil undergoes his transformation but never loses his edge. He becomes a better Phil, not a different Phil. The movie doesn't get all soppy at the end. There is the dark period when he tries to kill himself, the reckless period when he crashes his car because he knows it doesn't matter, the times of despair. We see that life is like that. Tomorrow will come, and whether or not it is always Feb. 2, all we can do about it is be the best person we know how to be. The good news is that we can learn to be better people. There is a moment when Phil tells Rita, ""When you stand in the snow, you look like an angel."" The point is not that he has come to love Rita. It is that he has learned to see the angel.",BARRYC_Doc6_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Positive,Groundhog_Day
46,BARRYC_Doc7_GroundhogDay,"The most horrible thing about life is not knowing what's going to happen next. Or at least that's what we have thought up till now. But ""Groundhog Day,"" Harold Ramis's brilliantly imaginative, wildly funny new comedy starring Bill Murray, demonstrates that there is something even more horrible -- knowing exactly what's going to happen next. This isn't merely a subtext of ""Groundhog Day."" It is the movie's core -- and that, along with a masterfully loony performance by Murray, makes this the best American comedy since ""Tootsie."" The movie is like some insane mongrel commingling of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""The Twilight Zone"" and Luis Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel."" Yet it is very much a film by the man who directed Murray (with another burrowing rodent) in ""Caddyshack."" In other words, it springs straight from the heart of the great tradition of American trash surrealism, which is precisely what makes it so immediately and delightfully accessible, so multilayered and rich without pretension. In the Bunuel film, sterling aristocrats gather for dinner, but afterward find themselves inexplicably trapped in the dining room, perhaps, they fear, for all eternity. This is something like what happens to Phil, a self-important Pittsburgh weatherman, except that there is nothing sterling about Phil and, if anything, his situation is even more disturbingly peculiar. Phil is not a liked man, nor is he likable; he is, in short, a case of walking halitosis, which makes him a perfect character for Murray. At the beginning of the picture he, his fetching new producer (Andie MacDowell) and his cameraman (Chris Elliot) make their annual winter pilgrimage to Punxsutawney, Pa., to visit another Phil, the world's most famous weather forecaster, on Groundhog Day. From the outset, it's a toss-up as to which Phil is more rodentlike. The human Phil looks upon this assignment with the grim anticipation of a man facing the gallows. Certainly, he's far too big a star for this kind of Hicksville human-interest stuff, and his mission seems to be to make everyone he comes into contact with as miserable as he is. All he wants to do is shoot the segment, pack up the gear and get back to Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, a blizzard blocks the roads and downs all the phone lines, so all he can do is head back to his hotel, pull the covers over his head and wait for tomorrow. Only tomorrow never comes. At 6 a.m., the radio alarm clock next to his bed awakens him, just as it had the day before, with the same song -- Sonny and Cher singing ""I Got You, Babe"" -- and the same inane patter. When the hotel clerk, the restaurant hostess, his producer, his cameraman -- everyone -- all speak exactly the same words they had spoken to him the day before, Phil realizes he has a problem. He's stuck in his own private Hades, in Punxsutawney, on Feb. 2. After a few days of this, most films would run out of invention and grow tiresome. But Ramis, who wrote the script with Danny Rubin, comes up with so many inspired variations on the day's events, and runs Murray through so many different reactions to his ordeal, that we never grow bored. How could we, with Murray ricocheting from elation to suicidal despair to depressed resignation? Murray is a breed unto himself, a sort of gonzo minimalist. And he's never been funnier as a comedian or more in control as an actor than he is here. It's easily his best movie. After absorbing the initial shock, Phil becomes giddy with his new-found freedom. His actions, he discovers, have no consequences whatsoever. He can eat anything, drink anything, do anything to anybody, and tomorrow morning at 6, the slate is wiped clean. Being the sleaze that he is, he immediately takes full advantage -- setting up beautiful women today for tomorrow's seduction, robbing banks and performing minor miracles. Phil's main target, though, is Rita (MacDowell), his producer, a sweet, smart, kindhearted beauty who under normal circumstances would brush him off like so much dandruff. But one night, after trying and trying again, day after day, compiling lists of her favorite poems, her favorite songs, her favorite ice cream flavors, he is able to break down her resistance and almost get her into bed. This near-miss is the best he can manage, though, and he decides, first, to drive himself off a cliff, then to electrocute himself, step in front of a bus, and, finally, hurl himself off a high building. But it's no go. Come the morn, he's back where he started. Though bewitchingly pretty, MacDowell has never really found her niche in the movies, but playing this knucklehead brand of modern screwball comedy, she has finally come into her own. Her scenes with Murray have an otherworldly sort of chemistry (with Murray, what else is possible?). And his vermin eccentricity releases a charming flakiness in her; for the first time, her endearing awkwardness really seems to work. Ramis has always been a better actor and writer than director. But here he shows remarkably keen comic timing, especially in the way he surprises us by cutting, at just the right instant, from one high point to another. With a script as beautifully complex as this one, Ramis and his cast have half of their work done for them. There is a moral to the tale as well, and it even strikes an uplifting note. But, for once, the audience isn't forced to surrender its intelligence (or its healthy cynicism) to embrace the film's sunny resolution. When Phil has his change of heart, he doesn't suddenly become a stranger. He's the same man, the same jerk, but a far wiser, more likable jerk. With another star, the movie's message might have been insufferably icky. But Murray's double-jointed ironic charm is our insurance against dishonest optimism. If this caterpillar becomes a butterfly, it's a butterfly with a lot of worm left in him.",BARRYC_Doc7_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Positive,Groundhog_Day
47,BARRYC_Doc8_GroundhogDay,"In ""Groundhog Day,"" playing a formerly smug weatherman who finds himself condemned to relive one Feb. 2 over and over again in Punxsutawney, Pa., Bill Murray explains his feelings to two bleary-eyed, beer-drinking locals. ""What would you do if you were stuck in one place and everything was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered?"" he asks despairingly. The two strangers listen very sympathetically. They didn't have to be trapped by a magic spell to know what he means. That glimmer of recognition is what makes ""Groundhog Day"" a particularly witty and resonant comedy, even when its jokes are more apt to prompt gentle giggles than rolling in the aisles. The story's premise, conceived as a sitcom-style visit to the Twilight Zone, starts out lightweight but becomes strangely affecting. Phil Connors, Mr. Murray's amusingly rude Pittsburgh television personality, surely deserves to be punished for his arrogance. But who in the audience hasn't ever wished time would stand still and offer a second, third or even a 20th chance? The jaded Phil, a perfect character for Mr. Murray, begins the story sounding terminally smooth. He refers to himself as ""talent,"" and addresses a fellow newscaster as ""Hairdo."" He sneers at Punxsutawney and is contemptuous of his own charming producer (Andie MacDowell) and darkly funny cameraman (Chris Elliott). He even delivers pleasant-sounding insults to the proprietors of the bed-and-breakfast where he is staying, not realizing he may be staying there forever. As directed breezily by Harold Ramis (who wrote the screenplay with Danny Rubin), ""Groundhog Day"" employs the sort of time-bending trickery that worked so well for ""Back to the Future."" Thus, Phil finds himself revisiting the recent past and coming face to face with people not fully aware of his special powers. On the first Feb. 2, he is cheerfully odious to everyone he meets, including an insurance salesman named Ned (Stephen Tobolowsky, hilarious as the quintessential pest). But as time goes by -- or doesn't -- Phil begins to try out different gambits, testing the limits of his plight. He learns that he can do nothing bad enough to keep himself from waking up under the same flowered quilt, listening to Sonny and Cher sing ""I Got You, Babe"" on the clock radio at 6 A.M. Not even smashing the radio to bits will make them shut up. Wildly frustrated at first, Phil gradually begins to treat his plight as a learning experience. He can, for instance, take enough piano lessons to impress Ms. MacDowell's enchanting Rita, once he realizes how wrong he was to treat her badly. One of the film's many repetitive sequences shows Phil on a date with Rita, learning so much about her that he can begin sounding like a mind reader and passing himself off as the perfect mate. ""You couldn't plan a day like this!"" Rita finally sighs happily. ""Well, you can,"" says Phil. ""It just takes an awful lot of work."" The film makes the most of the sentimental possibilities in Phil's rehabilitation. (Viewers who notice Phil ignoring a panhandler on his first Groundhog Day will surely know where that setup is headed.) But it also has fun with the nihilism. Phil eagerly explores every self-destructive possibility now open to him, from jumping off buildings to smoking cigarettes to overeating and refusing to floss; at one point he even casually robs an armored truck, just to see if he can. ""Well, what if there is no tomorrow?"" he anxiously asks someone. ""There wasn't one today!"" Mr. Murray is back in top form with a clever, varied role that draws upon the full range of his talents. As in ""Scrooged,"" he makes a transition from supreme cynic to nice guy, and this time he does so with particularly good grace. Half Capra and half Kafka, the story of ""Groundhog Day"" presents golden opportunities, particularly in the gently romantic scenes with Ms. MacDowell. Mr. Murray is as believable and appealing at these moments as he is flinging insults. Ms. MacDowell, a warm comic presence and a thorough delight, plays a modern working woman while also reminding viewers that this is at heart a fairy tale. As Phil tries one desperate tactic after another, fairy tale fans will be way ahead of him, knowing what it takes to break a spell. ""Groundhog Day"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

48,BARRYC_Doc9_GroundhogDay,"Working within the confines of what could have been an amazingly restricting idea -- that weatherman Bill Murray is trapped in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on February 2, forced to live Groundhog Day over and over -- co-writer/director Ramis has instead fashioned a surprisingly romantic comedy. At 6am on February 2, Murray wakes up to Sonny and Cher, and apart from covering the ceremonies and being prevented by a blizzard from returning home, he really doesn't do much. He's cynical, lazy and emotionally distanced, a semi-star and major weatherman in the Pittsburgh market. The next morning as 5:59am switches to 6am, Sonny and Cher come on again and he encounters the same stranger on the stairs, the same proprietor in the dining room, the same old high school classmate on the street. Waiting at the ceremonies, his producer (MacDowell) and cameraman (Elliott) still don't like him. More and more freaked, he goes through the day and awakens the next morning to Sonny and Cher and the whole town heading out to see whether or not Punxsutawney Phil is going to see his shadow. There were a lot of ways for this film to go stupid; it succumbs to none of them. At first, Murray tries to find a way out. He confides in his producer, a doctor, and a psychiatrist -- nobody gets it. Then he begins to use the recurrence to his advantage. Approaching an attractive woman, he finds out her name, high school, and 12th grade teacher. The next day for Murray, which is the same day for everyone else, he pretends to be an old high school friend of hers and uses this opening to seduce her. He begins to pig out as well, eating and drinking and carrying on. Eventually he begins to kill himself. But he's also falling more and more in love with MacDowell and begins to pursue her. At first, he manipulatively goes after her, day after day, fine-tuning his approach. At every junction of his seduction if he fails, he asks her what is wrong and the next day, which to her is still his first attempt, he adapts his approach. Finally, he realizes he wants more than just to sleep with her and he begins to change himself, day after day, which is the same day, Groundhog Day. Although we are trapped in the same day, and the film pretty much respects the logical boundaries, the situations unfold differently (to some extent) and though it's basically the same day over and over, new characters, situations and information are introduced all the time. Ramis wisely unravels his plot, using both variation and repetition to terrific effect, as you know what is coming but not exactly how it is going to happen. It's all believable, in a way. When Murray is first trapped, he tries to get out. Then he figures out what's going on and uses it to his advantage, after which he goes through a period of despair and finally, growth. Within the confines of this repetition, Ramis, Murray and MacDowell work wonders. The best of Ramis' early work as a writer and/or director, including Meatballs, Stripes, the truly bizarre Caddyshack, and Ghostbusters, mixed moments of genuine madcap humor with adolescent frat boy posturing. Sadly perhaps, Groundhog Day represents a mature Ramis, the film is more consistent and perceptive. In Jacques Rivette's 3 1/2-hour masterpiece, Celine and Julie Go Boating, during the last half hour, he does much the same thing. Characters go back to visit situations they previously lived. The Rivette film used this situation as a way to comment on form, on narrative structure, on memory and on film. Ramis uses it as a remarkable metaphor for mundane life, for life without love. In many ways we're all trapped in the same day over and over again and the way out, Ramis suggests, is through ourselves.",BARRYC_Doc9_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Positive,Groundhog_Day
49,BARRYC_Doc10_GroundhogDay,"Bill Murray’s trademark performance is at work in ""Groundhog Day"" as he perfects the pompous, self-absorbed, and sarcastic figure he personified in numerous prior roles, including ""Tootsie"" and ""Ghostbusters."" The picture as a whole also stands out as one of the most cleverly scripted, smartly edited, and emotionally moving ever made, even being inducted into the U.S. National Film Registry for its artistic significance. It’s a wholeheartedly feel-good experience with generous bits of morals, oodles of hilarious pessimism mixed with enchanting hope, and bitingly hysterical routines. The simple premise it presents is also one of the most thought-provoking, highlighting a timeless comedy sure to inspire viewers with its jovial ethics and antics. WPBH Channel 9 Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) travels once again (for the fourth year in a row) to the monotonous February 2nd Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. At the party center of Gobbler’s Knob, an oversized rodent will predict the remaining duration of winter. Teamed with overenthusiastic producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and quirky cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot), permanently cranky Phil barely makes it through the day; he hostilely confronts seemingly random inconveniences, including running into an old high school nuisance, stepping in a muddy pothole, and waking up to the annoying local radio station announcers. Stuck in the small town overnight due to a blizzard he failed to predict, Phil wakes up the following morning to Groundhog Day ... again! Assuming he’s experiencing déjà vu, he visits a neurologist (a delightful cameo by director Harold Ramis) and then a psychiatrist, only to be told that there’s nothing wrong with him. Hoping it’s all just a bad dream, Phil awakes the next morning to the exact same nightmare; he’s stuck reliving Groundhog Day for what could potentially be the rest of his life. He realizes that no matter what is accomplished during his one repeated day, the following sunup wipes the slate clean - so he decides to use this to his advantage, exploiting a world without consequences. Memorizing information about townsfolk so he can pick up women, evade the police, and rob a bank, he quickly grows tired of his cursed immortality. Stuck in a viciously never-ending cycle, he even turns to thoughts of suicide. MacDowell sweetly portrays the love interest who, despite Connor’s knowledgeable advances (from note-taking), proves to be the hardest woman to win over - and therefore the most appealing. Chris Elliot provides comic relief from Murray’s own brand of cynical humor, though Murray’s convincing performance, handling exceptional dialogue from writers Ramis and Danny Rubin, single-handedly makes this movie a poignant masterpiece (one brilliantly incorporating drama with the hilarity). Ramis makes a lively film out of few sets and a cast of only a handful of actors. The uniqueness of the plot requires nothing more, since it employs an ingenious fantasy idea like the unpredictable ones found in ""Big"" or ""Splash."" Perhaps what is most profound about this twist on a Dickensian fable is the comic way in which the seven stages of grief are alternatingly visualized. Not only does Phil deny and then plead with the truths and horrors of his condition, but he also eventually moves beyond a solution to his own plight. At a certain point, his motives turn to helping others, going so far as to repetitiously experiment with life and death scenarios until a suitable outcome presents itself. Is it all a blessing or a curse? Could this quandary actually be perceived in varying perspectives, as a drunken bowler and a love interest casually suggest? Here, true happiness is found in selflessness - the kind of thematic message that practically sums up the idealistic meaning of life itself, despite arising in an over-the-top, fantastical romantic comedy. The editing is also outstanding; while the script doesn’t involve time travel per se, it’s definitely an alteration of the standard narrative timeline, marking one of those rare cinematic occasions when extreme repetition only gets funnier. When Connor collects information on people, the film is pieced together with segments reminiscent of bloopers; Murray’s frustration and practiced techniques of redoing events over and over are superb - a goofy, sad, heartwarming series of trial-and-error revisions. Astounding in its structuring, romantic stature, examination of values, (including multi-faceted desperation and mortality through character introspection), and laugh-out-loud funny moments, ""Groundhog Day"" is an unmissable contemporary classic, appropriately voted as the 34th funniest American movie of the last century by the American Film Institute.",BARRYC_Doc10_GroundhogDay,BARRYC,Comedy,Positive,Groundhog_Day
50,CEC_Doc1_RedNotice,"Lifting its title from Interpol’s most-wanted list, “Dodgeball” director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s twisty treasure-hunt lark “Red Notice” blurs the lines between good guys and bad guys, and instead focuses on which of two notorious art thieves is better at breaking the law: sarcastic master forger Nolan Booth (a reliably whiny Ryan Reynolds) or his upscale nemesis, known only as “the Bishop” (a more wine-and-diney Gal Gadot). Their goal is to collect three ornamental orbs — worth some $300 million, but only as a set — originally gifted from Anthony to Cleopatra, then scattered to the corners of the globe. While Booth and the Bishop ricochet around the world, engaging in what amounts to a high-stakes Easter egg hunt, criminal profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) tries to bring them in, making for a fun, fast-paced and frequently amusing divertissement. Released by Netflix first in theaters Nov. 5, then streaming for subscribers a week later, “Red Notice” works surprisingly well for what it is. The script, which Thurber wrote himself, sets off blazing, as Booth steals Cleopatra’s first egg, narrowly escaping Hartley’s clutches, only to be apprehended when he arrives home in another hemisphere. Then the Bishop pops up, swipes the recovered prize, and lands Hartley in hot water, since the Interpol agent in charge, Inspector Das (Ritu Arya), now suspects the former FBI profiler of snagging it himself. Next thing Hartley knows, he’s sharing a cell with Booth in some remote Russian prison. We’re squarely in ’80s and ’90s action-movie territory here, and Thurber (who took improbability to new heights with the Rock-starring “Skyscraper”) certainly knows how to deliver wild and well-choreographed fights, chases and other stunt-driven set-pieces. Take that first heist, when Booth runs through the museum, only to find himself cornered in a room with a giant metal scaffold, which he proceeds to unhook one pin at a time, until the whole thing comes crashing down. In so doing, Reynolds nimbly outwits his pursuers the way Jackie Chan might have back in the day. The influence of Indiana Jones on Thurber’s splashy travelogue is undeniable. Also channeled are retro favorites like James Cameron’s “True Lies” (including a sexy tango in which a big lug in a tuxedo — Johnson, not Schwarzenegger, in this case — makes himself irresponsibly conspicuous while undercover). Even more fun than the retro action is the old-fashioned dynamic between these three frenemies, who must cautiously agree to work together in order to locate all of Cleopatra’s eggs. There’s an unmistakable screwball-comedy quality to the repartee, as unlikely partners Booth and Hartley bicker, or anytime the Bishop shows up and upstages the other two. It’s been widely reported that on the “Deadpool” movies, Reynolds improvises (or otherwise comes prepared with) many of his jokes, and the snarky thief he plays here feels like an extension of irreverent cut-ups he’s embodied before. Naturally, that attitude ruptures whatever reality audiences are supposed to buy into, but it’s worth it, since his zingers so often land. Reynolds is one of the few contemporary leading men who can consistently get away with winking at the audience throughout a performance. Nearly everyone else in Hollywood is expected to act, or at least pretend to disappear into character. Along the same lines, no one buys Johnson as a mild-mannered FBI profiler (when Das tells him he doesn’t look the part, he responds with an appropriately weary “I get that a lot”), but it’s satisfying to suspend disbelief and see what the Rock will do with the role. Meanwhile, Gadot, who was propelled to A-list status by “Wonder Woman” just a few years ago, gets to demonstrate that she has a sense of humor, too, as the Bishop teases and torments the others. Her nickname hails from chess, though watching “Red Notice” feels more like a really good game of checkers, where the players keep things lively by jumping several of their opponent’s pieces in a single turn. These three are constantly outsmarting one another, such that Cleopatra’s eggs change hands often, while cuffs frequently bind the wrong wrists. Booth and Hartley are stuck together enough that they have no choice but to try getting along, as the now-framed fed breaks countless laws in order to clear his name, while a bromance slowly builds between them. Thurber has a peculiar take on the morality of all this art theft. The first heist takes place in a museum, but the next two are presented as essentially victimless crimes. The second egg belongs to a notorious arms dealer named Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos), while the third is stashed away in a secret Nazi bunker packed with stolen artifacts, so they’re essentially fair game. “Look for a box that says ‘MacGuffin,’” quips Reynolds, citing Hitchcock’s term for the otherwise-unimportant plot device that motivates a thriller. Once reunited, the three eggs don’t conjure some all-powerful laser beam from the sky (thank goodness, as that’s an even more tired cliché), but instead serve as the ultimate wedding present to a profligate billionaire’s spoiled daughter — and there’s a second surprise waiting to upstage the gift once the time comes. It’s all reasonably clever, so long as you don’t scrutinize it too closely. “Red Notice” could be Thurber’s spin on “National Treasure,” with just as much DNA from the RKO classic “Gunga Din.” The writer-director proves plenty adept at coming up with excuses for these characters to infiltrate and escape elaborately protected locations, and though the movie relies a bit too much on cumbersome exposition (the film’s first minutes are some of the clunkiest the genre has ever seen), it moves quickly enough that most audiences won’t stumble into — or even stop to question — the plot’s many holes. Like a skilled con artist, the movie steals your time, but leaves you feeling like you got the more advantageous end of the deal.",CEC_Doc1_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Positive,Red_Notice
51,CEC_Doc2_RedNotice,"A buddy action-comedy that blends elements of James Bond, Mission: Impossible, Entrapment, Indiana Jones, True Lies, The Fugitive, and many, many more, Red Notice is a welcome throwback to the days before omnipresent franchises and IP, when movie stars and original (or, in this case, “original”) blockbusters ruled the industry. Of course, writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s spectacular isn’t—save for one limited week, beginning Nov. 5—arriving in multiplexes as its predecessors did; rather, it’s debuting on Netflix (Nov. 12) as the streaming platform’s most expensive endeavor to date, at a reported cost of upwards of $200 million. Nonetheless, there’s something refreshingly old school about this mega-budget project, which puts all of its money on the screen in one giant globetrotting set piece after another while hinging its success on the charisma of its sexy, bruising, funny leads. In the mid-’90s, Red Notice would have resembled any number of summer movies built around the appeal of marquee headliners and a slam-bang premise. Today, however, it feels practically anachronistic, and it’s refreshing to have a gaudily expensive production such as this strive to entertain through lots of frantic sizzle and witty one-liners, the last of which come via Ryan Reynolds, one-third of the film’s A-list trio that also includes Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Gal Gadot. There’s no depth here; only a well-worn text that’s been retrofitted with occasional CGI. As such, it’s the sort of venture they generally don’t make anymore, and the fact that it’s made pretty well immediately casts it as an antidote to the endless barrage of superhero, sci-fi, and horror sequels and retreads that now dominate the marketplace. Put another way: Red Notice is akin to a slightly higher class of junk food that you haven’t eaten in a while, and much of the satisfaction derived from its nonsense is due to the participation of Reynolds. As cocky master thief Nolan Booth, the Deadpool and Free Guy star does exactly what he always does, which is flash his pearly whites with a self-consciously arrogant twinkle in his eye and crack wise whenever possible. In Red Notice, that’s just about every time he opens his mouth; Thurber’s script imagines Booth as a limitless fount of snarky pop culture-inflected quips. Many of those remarks are funny in and of themselves (for example, after some Johnson clumsiness at a black-tie event, Reynolds exclaims, “You look like a well-dressed wall!”). Yet it’s the ceaselessness of his jokey barrage that’s truly winning; at a certain point, one simply winds up chuckling at Reynolds’ inexhaustible supply of silly jibes and retorts. If you don’t have a high tolerance for Reynolds’ schtick, Red Notice won’t win you over, since he’s the comedic third of a triptych in which Johnson serves as the straight-man muscle and Gadot functions as the sultry villainess. That structure isn’t very novel but it does allow each star to play to their strengths, and it results in a three-way dynamic that allows for creative mismatches, both in terms of banter and skirmishes. Reynolds and Johnson are a bickering little-big pair, Reynolds and Gadot share a competitive dueling-burglar rapport, and Johnson and Gadot have a flirtatious-adversary chemistry, all of which is exploited in a variety of different locales that keeps things fresh, be it an imposing Rome art museum, a wintry Russian prison, an opulent Valencia mansion, or the lush jungles of Argentina. You’ll notice that I’ve yet to discuss the actual plot of Red Notice, and that’s largely because it’s an amalgamation of many oft-told tales that’s just the pretext for seeing these actors strut their highly particular stuff. Thurber’s saga concerns three priceless bejeweled eggs that Mark Antony gave to Cleopatra, one of which has been lost to time. Booth covets them as a means of proving that he’s the greatest thief in the world, and so too does his rival, the Bishop (Gadot); John Hartley (Johnson), meanwhile, is the FBI profiler driven to stop them both from pulling off their robberies. As far as setups go, it’s relatively routine, although the film stages its daring heists, outrageous prison breaks, and treasure hunting with gusto, assuming various guises—a little Ghost Protocol here, a bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark there—with a verve that makes its conventionality go down smoother. There are double-crosses and surprises aplenty in Red Notice, some of them telegraphed more egregiously than others, and its well-executed fights and gags maintain a lively atmosphere that’s far more important than the preposterousness of its narrative twists and turns. Arms dealers, torture, SWAT teams, and rockets that miraculously pass through the doors of a flying helicopter are all part of its overstuffed and absurd stew. Thurber smartly leans into the inherent ridiculousness of his endeavor—as well as has Reynolds make a couple of overt cracks about it—without letting things tip into parody. That balancing act is matched by the performances of Johnson, Gadot, and Reynolds, who appear to be having a blast embodying characters that are less three-dimensional human beings than exaggerated riffs on their own distinctive big-screen personas. Red Notice embraces a typical banter-chase-banter-fight-banter-explosion formula, and its script is split evenly between Reynolds smart-assery and functional exposition, the latter of which sometimes turns out to be merely more of the former. It’s got the energy of an eager-to-please puppy dog, and a pedal-to-the-metal pace that helps it blow past most questionable plot developments. The film comes across as a combination of Thurber’s prior two Johnson collaborations (Central Intelligence and Skyscraper), and though he’s no great visual stylist, the writer/director handles his material’s numerous modes with proficiency, infusing his PG-13 violence with wit (and vice versa) in order to keep the proceedings light and amusing. They’re also lavish, even if a handful of scenes can’t hide their chintzy CGI set-design effects. Despite operating as a stand-alone affair that’s untethered to Marvel, DC, Star Wars, or another Happy Meal-friendly property, Red Notice ultimately reveals its own desire to be a franchise.

52,CEC_Doc3_RedNotice,"It goes without saying that Netflix has evolved into a major player in the world of movies. The Los Gatos, Calif.- based streaming service has amassed more than 50 Academy Award nominations (including five for Best Picture), and its films have won a total of 15 Oscars. But Netflix has also poured millions of dollars into developing its own line of big-budgeted blockbusters. The new poster child for that initiative is ""Red Notice,"" a $200 million action comedy featuring three of the biggest names in Hollywood entertainment. ""Red Notice"" is written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Skyscraper,"" ""Central Intelligence""). The film stars Dwayne Johnson, the highest paid actor in Hollywood (that's still a wild notion to digest), Gal Gadot, one of the highest paid women in Hollywood, and Ryan Reynolds, a likable schtick-driven actor with an enthusiastic following of his own. That's a lot of box office star power and securing all three for your movie is a sizable investment in itself. Just based on the talent alone, you should have a good idea of what you're going to get from ""Red Notice"" -- plenty of action scenes, just as many laughs, lots of charisma and an ending that leaves the door open for a sequel if this one proves profitable. In other words, your standard blockbuster blueprint. But I don't mean that as a knock. I've always had an affection for popcorn movies when they're done well. Even when they stick close to the familiar formula. For the most part ""Red Notice"" is one of the well-done ones. To its credit it knows exactly the kind of movie it wants to be, and it never deviates from that vision. That's something that proves to be a strength and a weakness. Thurber and company stick with what works and have a great time doing it. And you never have to worry about the movie taking itself seriously. But at the same time, the relentless gags and overall silliness can get a little exhausting. And those looking for even the smallest amount of dramatic tension won't find it here. This overall fun smorgasbord of genres goes as heavy into comedy as it does action. But it also throws in some heist thriller elements and a bit of swashbuckling adventure. Johnson gets top billing playing FBI beefcake John Hartley, a seasoned profiler with the Bureau who specializes in art crime. The film opens as Hartley and Inspector Das (Ritu Arya) from Interpol arrive at Rome's renowned Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant' Angelo. Inside the museum is one of three bejeweled eggs given to Cleopatra from Mark Antony. The second egg is in a private collection in Spain and the location of the third remains a mystery. So why is all this egg talk important? An Egyptian billionaire is offering $300 million to whoever delivers him all three eggs by his daughter's wedding day. It's an obscene amount of money that's sure to draw attention which is why Hartley is in Rome. He received a tip that renowned con artist Nolan Booth (Reynolds) is in town to swipe egg number one. But there's a third player who factors into the equation -- the sphinxlike ""most wanted art thief in the world"" (Gadot) who watches from afar with a ton of resources at her disposal. Now grab a pen and paper. This fast-moving caper launches with a wild chase sequence in Rome where Booth and the egg slips through Hartley's fingers. There's a brief stop in Bali where Hartley tracks down and apprehends Booth. Then its back to Rome where Hartley discovers the egg he has retrieved is fake and he has in fact been framed for the theft by a mysterious shadowy character known as The Bishop. Hartley and Booth get shipped to a frigid Siberian prison (don't ask) where they learn the true identity of The Bishop (Gadot). You get all of that? It may sound like I'm giving up a lot of the plot, but I'm not, really. All of that is mostly setup for this around-the-world jaunt that also makes stops in London, Egypt, and Argentina among other scenic locales. Along the way, Thurber puts together a number of high-energy set pieces including a crazy prison escape, a gag-filled fight sequence in Valencia, and a wild car chase through a mine shaft. Not every action scene works (there's an especially dumb sequence inside a Spanish bullring), but they're mostly entertaining and clearly a huge chunk of the budget went into them. As for the three stars, each delivers exactly what you expect from them. The magnetic Johnson flexes his big muscles and his bigger personality. The playfully seductive Gadot seems to be having a blast. And the quick-witted Reynolds plays straight to type, with a joke-a-second cadence that offers up plenty of laughs while testing your endurance. Together the trio have good chemistry, riffing on a number of well-worn action movie tropes and checking all the boxes most of us look for in our popcorn escapism.",CEC_Doc3_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Positive,Red_Notice
53,CEC_Doc4_RedNotice,"Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, Red Notice tells the story of unlikely partners doing what they can to save a priceless piece of history. FBI agent John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) gets a tip that one of the most expensive art pieces in the world is about to be stolen. When it is, he is forced to team up with art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) to track and take down the most prolific art thief in the world, The Bishop (Gal Gadot). With bumps along the way, the union of Hartley and Booth will prove to be far more difficult than either expected, but their journey will be one for the books. Anyone who has followed Dwayne Johnson throughout his acting career is well aware that nearly every one of his films is absurd but tons of fun. Point being the Fast and Furious series: he jumps from buildings, survives massive explosions, and completes feats that would, for anyone else, be impossible. The neverending action, the ridiculous comedy, and the incredible journeys on which Johnson’s characters often take viewers serve their purpose and typically entertain (sometimes ironically) from beginning to end. Red Notice, in nearly every way, except for the characters’ names, could be part of the Fast and Furious franchise. The action is uncanny, the comedy absurd, and every second is incredibly fun. The three Hollywood titans play so well together they allow the best of each other to come out and are imminently watchable and fun from the jump. Sure, some terrific actors are present, but given that Johnson’s movies aren’t predicated on superb acting, my expectation was for something average while other aspects shined brightly. I couldn’t have been more wrong, as each of those three leads is so incredibly astute in their performances. In fact, this may be Gal Gadot’s best performance to date. Dwayne Johnson is his typical, charming, delightful self. Ryan Reynolds isn’t typically known for his deep, complex roles, as he generally is seen as a comedian, which he handles incredibly well. However, Red Notice allows him to shine in dramatic moments as well, and his performance is beautiful. There aren’t many heavy beats present, but the actor hits each one brilliantly. If you’re looking for something realistic with true emotional relevance, well, then Thurber’s action-comedy isn’t for you. There are touching tidbits sprinkled throughout, but what you are going to get is the high-octane action and incredible stunts for which Johnson has come to be known. In terms of action and story, the action flick is precisely what one might expect going in. But, it is even more fun than I could have hoped. The marriage of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot is beautiful, and they support one another incredibly well. Red Notice is an example of the best of what these three have to offer the world, and I’m impressed by what this cast and crew bring to the table. It’s funny, action-packed, and fun, which is exactly as it should be.",CEC_Doc4_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Positive,Red_Notice
54,CEC_Doc5_RedNotice,"Only the greatest criminals in the world get a red notice, the official tag that Interpol slaps on you when you consistently break the law at a high level. The good news about Rawson Marshall Thurber’s new film, also called “Red Notice,” is that this film critic won’t be slapping a “do not see” tag on this action-adventure. This is pure escapist fun, powered by star-driven lead actors. The organically-trained cinephile will argue that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot don’t do much acting in “Red Notice,” but that’s exactly the idea. This Netflix-funded production is the perfect bowl of Halloween adult-stolen candy on a Friday night where the brain gets turned off and the smile count goes up. The plot revolves around Johnson’s FBI profiler reluctantly teaming up with an art thief (Reynolds) to track down Cleopatra’s legendary eggs, the luscious pearl of the art world in Thurber’s film. The only thing in their way is Gadot’s master criminal, who makes life hard for the wise-cracking duo. Hot on all three of their trails is Interpol (aka red notice stamper) Inspector Das (Ritu Arya). The locales start in Rome and race around the world, including stops in London and Argentina. Much of what you expect to happen does indeed occur, but that’s not the point. Escapist fun is rarely smart and doesn’t carry much depth, but the nice thing here is that the humor outweighs the mindless action. Yes, there are car chases, fist fights, gun battles, and every other kind of genre quota-meeting attack–but the laughs are frequent and well-earned. After my chaotic morning, I turned this on and got lost in the craziness of it all. No human being could bounce off a brick roof, get electrocuted, punched and kicked a hundred times, and still manage to travel across the world in model-esque clothing. If you came to a movie where The Rock jumps off a poorly-constructed bridge-which is attached to a black site (for really bad people) prison-in the hopes of catching a moving helicopter in an extremely cold weather area for an award-caliber script, you reached the wrong room. ‘Red Notice” is the epitome of tongue-in-cheek entertainment. This is the movie you watch after “Remains of the Day” for a palette cleanser. Thurber’s script won’t win a cinematic Pulitzer and the story is quite outlandish, but the roles in it are perfectly tailored for the star’s talents. Gadot, who is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, is known to most moviegoers as the heroic Wonder Woman, so seeing her play the official “heel,” aka the antagonist, is a surprising thrill. instead of being the hero pursuing the bad parties, it’s Gadot waiting for the boys to come to the yard. She relishes the opportunity to beat up on the gents, and it makes for a lot of easy laughs. If Johnson is in the movie, just consider him a superhero in civilian clothing: someone who can jump out a window and crash through the awning of a shop straight onto a slab of concrete, and just bounce back like it was nothing. Or as Reynolds’ Booth refers to him at one point, “a well-dressed wall.” But Johnson also knows how to nail a witty line of dialogue and turn up the charisma in the blink of an eye. His talents match up perfectly with Reynolds, Hollywood’s class clown who is very much on cruise-control here. Thankfully, Reynolds’ cruise control is still a snarky line-delivering laugh machine. If you left “Hobbs and Shaw” wanting more of comedic interactions between Johnson and Reynolds, this movie will be a notice that one should be happy to receive. I smiled a lot during the crisp and fast-moving 100-minute run time (minus the credits, where you’re lighting a cigarette), and didn’t feel like my time was wasted. Good timing too. Right before the trials and tribulations of depressing movies, aka awards season, can begin, some good old fashioned (if familiar and slight) pleasure is in order. Go elsewhere for anything accused of carrying depth. This is a fun room.",CEC_Doc5_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Positive,Red_Notice
55,CEC_Doc6_RedNotice,"There’s a stinging form of déjà vu that can sweep over you when you’re watching a movie that feels like you’ve seen it before. Red Notice is so full of such moments that by the end, my skin was crawling. There’s turn off your brain and enjoy movies, and then there’s this. And no, its three ultra-famous headliners can’t rescue it from horrid mediocrity. Written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, Red Notice is less a movie and more a frenzied splattering of cliches, snatched from a barrage of action, espionage, and heist films. Your brain might notice some familiar fight staging, a half-remembered plot point, or the whistling of the Indiana Jones theme. Sadly, all these inspirations come from far superior movies, so watching this one feels like watching Blue Clue’s, where the hints are so pronounced that you might well pull an overeager Leonard DiCaprio meme. For starters, Dwayne Johnson swaggers onscreen playing a role we’ve seen him in plenty of times before: A no-nonsense cop forced to work hand-in-hand with a criminal that he high-key despises. Enter Ryan Reynolds, playing a part that feels like Deadpool drained of all his profane wit and left with quips like, “Why are you wearing the hairnet? You’re bald?” Finally, in swans Gal Gadot in glamorous Carmen Sandiego red attire, playing a thieving femme fatale, who can’t hold a candle to Fast and Furious’s Gisele. The specifics are these: FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson) is out to bust the world’s two rival art thieves: wise-cracking Nolan Booth (Reynolds) and less-wise cracking The Bishop (Gadot), who drops punchlines with no punch like “I also know your browser history.” (Remember when that joke was fresh? Then congrats, you too are old.) After a sleek switcheroo, Hartley’s good name is ruined as he’s framed for being in cahoots with Booth. To rescue his reputation, the pair will team up — through prison breaks, car chases, jungle runs, and a faceoff with a rampaging bull — to best The Bishop by stealing a long-lost artifact out from under her. In theory, this path is full of twists and turns. However, Thurber is coloring within the lines of convention, so all of it is infuriatingly predictable. The whole time I was anticipating every double-cross and secret reveal. So, yeah, it’s like watching a kids’ show and just wishing they’d solve the damn puzzle already. Perhaps Thurber thought he could mask these telegraphed twists by the sheer amount of exposition dumping, made up of way too many details about the characters’ childhoods, the tedious history of the fictional artifacts, and maniacal monologuing that’s best suited to Bond villains. Or perhaps Thurber thought razzle-dazzle might be a good distraction? I’m sure on paper all the action set pieces I glazed over above seemed exciting, as did the promise of a sultry tango scene between Johnson and Gadot. But all of the above is lacking. For instance, the dance scene is meant to tease a sexual tension between the good cop and the bad girl. However, Johnson has built his entire movie-star persona on being tough-as-nails but approachable. So when he attempts snarly smolder, it feels achingly stiff. Gadot is smirking and swiveling her hips, but there’s no spark between them, so this arc falls spectacularly flat. Also floundering is Gadot’s attempts at landing punchlines. Sure, she’s gotten some laughs in Wonder Woman, but while playing a wide-eyed fish-out-of-water, winsomely enchanted by babies and ice cream. Here, balancing sultry and sophisticated with zingers that don’t zing, she’s out of step. But she’s not alone. Johnson and Reynolds also struggle to make something out of Thurber’s insipid script, which forces the Deadpool star to re-enact the Marvel misfit's meta-commentary schitck with lines like “Sneak past the featured extras and into the bedroom” and “Look for a box that says MacGuffin!” No wonder he seems on cruise control. Reynolds is basically plagiarizing himself. And Johnson matches his enthusiasm (or lack thereof.) Worse though are the action sequences. Part of the problem is CGI that is simply subpar. There’s too stark a difference between real-life sets and their human actors and the rubbery CGI of a fake crumbling wall and animated Reynolds and Johnson tumbling out of it. Quick cuts might hide some seams between practical stunts and CGI, but it won’t save a bad edit. Early on in Reynold’s first escape scene, there’s a glaring error in an attempted match-on-action edit. This means when the camera moves from a wide shot to a closer shot, cutting through a moment of action so that it appears seamless. When it’s done wrong, the action looks stuttered as it does here. Beyond scratching at audience awareness of a movie’s artifice, it also compromises the collaborative performance between stunt man and star. So, what should be a scene where it seems Booth is getting out by the skin of his teeth feels like he’s toying with the hapless security guards in pursuit. It shifts the stakes, and not in a way that benefits the suspense of the scene. This is really a shame because it seems like this sequence — and Booth’s overall stunt physicality — is meant as an homage to Jackie Chan. Sure, Reynolds (and his stunt double) don’t have the masterful moves of this living legend. But in Booth’s frenzied physicality, there’s a fun sense of Chan’s brand of action, where it felt like anything could happen and ANYTHING could be an improvised weapon. But again, Red Notice makes these gestures without their bravado and creativity. So, you might notice the nods to Indiana Jones, James Bond, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, or even Michael Bay’s high-gloss, high saturated color aesthetic. But then you’ll be left wishing you’d just watched those instead. ",CEC_Doc6_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Negative,Red_Notice
56,CEC_Doc7_RedNotice,"Three of the biggest movie stars in the world converge for one big action-adventure spectacular, enlivened by (reported) $20 million paychecks and the rare thrill of playing around with fellow titans. That setup makes the new film Red Notice (Netflix, November 12) sound like some project from the late 1990s, before IP became the selling point and actors more incidental. But it is indeed a film from and for the here and now. In that, Red Notice serves as a reminder that, well, they just don’t make them like they used to. The stars in question are Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot, all actors from the franchise world. The experiment of Rawson Marshall Thurber’s film is to see if their respective styles can meld together into something that may kick off yet another franchise. It’s an experiment that Netflix reportedly spent $200 million to run. Alas, Red Notice is limp and dull, and does more to showcase the shortcomings of each of its marquee idols than it does to highlight their bankable charisma. A globe-trotting heist film that heavily relies on zippy banter, Red Notice never finds its groove, instead jerking around between familiar action sequences and humor that never lands. Johnson plays FBI profiler John Hartley, who’s tasked with preventing the theft of a priceless golden egg made by Marc Antony for his doomed love, Cleopatra. Hartley fails when the world’s greatest art thief, Reynolds’s Nolan Booth, absconds with the thing. There’s another, perhaps better thief in the mix as well: Gadot’s The Bishop. And, as it turns out, there are a total of three missing eggs that need collecting. These objects don’t have any magical, Ark of the Covenant-esque properties, but the Indiana Jones movies are nonetheless referenced in Red Notice, both in a Nazi-loot plotline and by Reynolds whistling a bit of John Williams’s theme music. Red Notice would be better off not reminding us of far better things. It’s fitting that Reynolds should be the one to do the referencing—as his character nods to lots of other old things, like Pulp Fiction and the way Borat says ""nice."" These irksome little non-jokes (Remember that thing??) aptly represent Reynolds’s grating performance, a schtick that’s seriously diminished in charm since Reynolds first trotted it out over 20 years ago. It feels lazy, like Reynolds is coasting on his Deadpool clout. Johnson, once again playing the swaggering but gentle hulk, fares a bit better, because he is generally a more winsome performer. But there’s still a halfhearted drag to his work here. Nothing in Marshall Thurber’s script helps Johnson, or anyone else, rise to the occasion. Gadot mostly just has to slink and sass and be smarter than the boys, doing a more wicked, but empty, riff on Diana Prince’s cool proficiency. She has discernible chemistry with neither Johnson nor Reynolds, who also have none with each another. Yet the movie is constantly telegraphing that we’re watching two icons bouncing off of one another, with surely dazzling results. Red Notice makes no effort to distinguish the characters that the actors are playing; it merely says, Look! They’re in the same movie! The film’s grim insistence that we are witnessing some seismic movie star coming-together makes one fret, a little, about the future of film iconography. Then again, available right now on Netflix (and, according to some early viewer data, playing like gangbusters there) is the gloriously invigorating Western The Harder They Fall. That film is loaded with starry swagger, its various heists and showdowns given effervescence by an ensemble of terrific, name-brand actors. Sure, that cast can’t quite match the collective box office numbers of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot. But maybe they should be given the chance to try—while the members of the $20 million club go learn some badly needed new tricks.",CEC_Doc7_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Negative,Red_Notice
57,CEC_Doc8_RedNotice,"If you assembled a focus group of frequent moviegoers and asked them to describe the elements of a good action film, they’d probably come up with something along the lines of Red Notice. The star-laden blockbuster, which is dropping on Netflix this week, features three A-list names, all in familiar roles: Dwayne Johnson as a tough FBI agent, Ryan Reynolds as a motormouthed art thief, and Gal Gadot as a mysterious criminal who forces the two men to team up against her. The work is complete with globe-trotting set pieces, self-aware jokes delivered straight to the camera, and constantly shifting loyalties as each character tries to stay ahead of the others on the quest for some glittery MacGuffin. Everything about Red Notice seems almost algorithmically determined, from the cast to the familiar tropes, so the association with Netflix, a company that prides itself on blending art and machine learning (at least in its recommendations), comes as no surprise. But this film was sought after by practically every major studio before a script even existed, based on its plot description and Johnson’s involvement alone. Netflix only later acquired the work, which was written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. I went into my screening wondering what about that original pitch was scintillating enough to spark such a frenzied bidding war—did it offer some fresh take on the action film, for example? What I saw disappointed me: Red Notice is a glossy but empty product that indicates the extent of the genre’s current crisis. That might seem like a dramatic pronouncement. Other types of movies, such as adult dramas and comedies, have started to vanish from big screens, but every week box offices are seemingly choked with blockbuster brawls. The genre has become essentially every studio’s economic powerhouse, resulting in uninspired predictability and heroes who are never actually in danger; the trashy artistry of 1980s and ’90s action classics is nothing more than a distant memory. Now many of the movies are tied to the same existing franchises (like James Bond or The Fast and the Furious), comic books, or video games. Johnson is one of the few stars who actually gets expensive, original action films made, but of late he’s tended toward disappointingly safe material. Red Notice is his most generic effort yet. In it, Johnson plays John Hartley, an FBI agent tasked with catching the notorious art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds). Booth is on the tail of three priceless golden eggs that were supposedly once owned by Cleopatra, but so is another bandit called the Bishop (Gadot). Hartley and Booth end up hunting around the world together, the former trying to bring the Bishop to justice, the latter looking for the treasure she’s seeking. The two dash through expensive-looking sequences set in glitzy museums, a bullfighting ring, and the deep South American jungle. They double-cross each other a few times along the way, but these betrayals only flimsily channel the oppositional buddy energy that helped drive classics such as 48 Hrs., Lethal Weapon, or Midnight Run back in the genre’s heyday. Nothing is inherently wrong with familiarity. Hollywood has always recycled formulas that audiences respond to, and a different version of Red Notice might have had a little more verve. But its three stars seem uninterested in fleshing out their performances beyond the bare minimum. Johnson’s Hartley isn’t so much a character as he is a collection of competent skills wrapped up in a muscular package; his only flaw appears to be that he works too hard. Reynolds stays in his usual territory, with a character who is almost identical to his best-known role as the wisecracking Deadpool—Booth references popular movies, deflates tension with snarky jokes, and fills dead air with winking bloviation. Gadot has by far the least screen time, and she uses it to do absolutely nothing of interest. The entire project seems designed to keep the stars within their comfort zones. I once described another Netflix film, the perfectly enjoyable Adam Sandler comedy Murder Mystery, as “background cinema.” Red Notice is the (reportedly) $200 million version of that. You can put it on the TV while you browse the internet on your phone, look up once in a while, and get the gist. Have you ever seen Dwayne Johnson throw someone across a room, or Ryan Reynolds snappily bicker before? Then why even look at the TV this time? It’s only more of the same. I’m sure Red Notice would play better on a big screen—basically any movie would—but imposing visuals, a booming sound system, and the inability to look at your phone still wouldn’t solve the film’s most fundamental issues. The story lacks tension, because while its premise depends on conflict among the three stars, all of them are hyper-professional masterminds who can extricate themselves out of any situation smoothly. They’re never in any true danger, and they don’t seem likely to undergo a permanent change or arrive at a major self-realization. When punches land in this film, they leave no bruise; when bullets hit, no blood gets spilled. I don’t necessarily expect realism from my action movies, but if everyone’s walking out of a scene unscathed, it’s hard to know why I should pay attention to the next one.",CEC_Doc8_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Negative,Red_Notice
58,CEC_Doc9_RedNotice,"A red notice, as helpfully defined by “Red Notice,” is the highest level of arrest warrant issued by Interpol. You might think of this detail as a red herring, given how little it really factors into the movie’s cheerfully hectic heist-caper plot. The title color, however, does get quite a workout: It pops up in the brilliant red gown Gal Gadot wears to a masquerade ball and in the red-ringed arena where Dwayne Johnson stares down a raging bull. And of course, it appears in the bright red Netflix logo that proudly kicks off the movie — the kind of noisily globe-trotting, tomb-raiding, rocket-launching entertainment that, a few years ago, would have been released by a traditional studio. That was actually the plan in 2018, when Universal Pictures greenlit “Red Notice” on the strength of Johnson’s attachment and presumably some hint of a premise (big guns, priceless artifacts, daddy issues — it writes itself). But a year later, before production began, the studio balked for widely speculated-about reasons: Maybe they finally took a look at writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s script, or maybe they were scared off by the (undeserved!) box office disappointment of “Skyscraper,” the previous Thurber-Johnson joint. Whatever the cause, Netflix snapped up the picture for more than $160 million, making it one of the costliest movies in the streamer’s history and dropping more than a few industry jaws. That was all before the pandemic, which delayed the movie’s production and normalized the once-unthinkable prospect of pricey studio movies (like, say, Gadot’s “Wonder Woman 1984”) becoming predominantly streaming experiences. All of which makes the tediously cranked-up “Red Notice” only slightly more interesting as a movie-industry story involving enormous quantities of money than it is as a fictional story involving enormous quantities of money. One hundred sixty million dollars is a hefty sum (and probably a conservative estimate), but it’s dwarfed by the $300 million payday being chased by this movie’s trio of disreputables. Johnson plays John Hartley, an FBI profiler who’s set his sights on Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), one of the world’s most wanted and obnoxiously deadpan art thieves. Soon they’re embroiled in a scheme centered on three bejeweled eggs once owned by Cleopatra, all of them now kept under lock and key in far-flung corners of the globe. Various sub-Dan Brown, sub-James Bond, sub-Indiana Jones shenanigans ensue: Windows shatter, scaffolding collapses and a brand spankin’ new Porsche lasts about five seconds into a not-so-thrilling chase in one of the movie’s better gags. The action leaps from a museum in Rome to a getaway in Bali to a prison in coldest Russia, which is where the no-nonsense agent and the wily thief go from reluctant cellmates to reluctant partners. Forcing their hand with a mischievous wink is Booth’s archrival in crime, the Bishop (Gadot), who has an annoying talent for playing Booth and Hartley off each other while remaining several steps merrily ahead. This forced triangulation adds a too-faint crackle of sexual tension and a whole lot of lopsided banter, with Reynolds predictably dominating the wisecracks while his co-stars have the general good sense not to even try keeping up. The miscast Gadot finds herself at a particular disadvantage. Whether she’s mocking a trussed-up intelligence analyst or applying electroshock paddles to Johnson’s nether-regions, she confirms — much as her luminously earnest Wonder Woman performances already suggested — that winking cynicism isn’t her strong suit. Johnson, a deft performer with a gift for self-mockery, fares somewhat better. As in Thurber’s delightfully dumb-but-not-so-dumb “Central Intelligence,” he finds himself cast as the bigger, buffer side in a rambunctious action-comedy bromance; in that movie, however, he and Kevin Hart both played against type and struck on a surprisingly fresh, counterintuitive dynamic. Johnson and Reynolds aren’t the worst action duo — they’re both good at dangling from roof railings — but their odd-couple bit is thin and predictable by comparison. Reynolds basically sits there shooting off his mouth, rattling off up-to-the-minute references to Instagram and Post Malone, while Johnson responds with mostly stony silence, his facial muscles occasionally stretching the short distance from exasperated to unimpressed. Put another way: Reynolds is there to mock and deconstruct the plot (“Look for a box that says ‘MacGuffin,’” he notes during a particularly dull stretch of the egg hunt), while Johnson and Gadot are on hand to earnestly recap it. And some recapping is admittedly helpful, given how busily Thurber piles on the narrative fake-outs and tedious side characters, including an Interpol killjoy (Ritu Arya) and a shirtless arms dealer (Chris Diamantopoulos) — all en route to an ending so inane that the characters seem faintly embarrassed to have to go along with it. A depressing reminder of what Hollywood considers “original” material these days, “Red Notice” plays one of those self-consciously convoluted, ultimately derivative long cons that strain so hard to seem breezily insouciant they wind up wearing you out. By the end, it’s the clichés that warrant a rest.",CEC_Doc9_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Negative,Red_Notice
59,CEC_Doc10_RedNotice,"One of the supposed beauties of Netflix, and all other streamers with access to such vast resources, is that without the panicked need for box office success, there’s a certain freedom that’s then afforded. The risks that might be deemed too precarious in the global marketplace (Too original? Too adult? Too gay?) are no longer of such prioritised concern and thus big budgets can be allocated to biggish bets. It’s why Netflix was confident to take on Martin Scorsese’s $160m crime saga The Irishman after Paramount deemed it too expensive and why the streamer also spent $70m to kick off the Old Guard franchise with a diverse cast and a central, uncensored queer romance. Both paid off (the films rank among the streamer’s most-watched) and showed that a brave new world away from the safe repetition of homogeneous superheroes, remakes and superhero remakes might be possible. So with the arrival of Red Notice, a film that allegedly cost upwards of $200m, making it Netflix’s biggest budget to date, one might hope for something slightly out of the ordinary, a much-needed tweak on what a traditional studio might otherwise lazily offer. But what makes the film so maddening, along with many, many other reasons, is that it’s the most boringly indistinctive patchwork job we’ve seen for a long while, a beige piece of committee-approved product that slums from point A to point B to who cares. Like an increasing number of the streamer’s mass-market offerings, the overriding message appears to be: see, we can make films just as badly as everyone else! So much for the great disruptor … The script was at one point the centre of a heated auction with all the majors jostling for rights before Universal snapped them up but down the line, there was trepidation over the expense and Netflix stepped in to give the green light instead. It’s easy to see why as there’s inherently safe global appeal – Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot starring in an action comedy about global heists – elements that would make this worth the investment in or outside of the lower stakes world of streaming. But while the stage is set for a sleek James Bond meets Indiana Jones meets Ocean’s Eleven meets Dirty Rotten Scoundrels caper, writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber stumbles on his way there, misfiring on every conceivable level, a film trying so hard to recall the fun of other films that it forgets to have any fun for itself. A red notice is a type of high-level international warrant afforded to an on-the-run-criminal, causing FBI agent John Hartley (Johnson) to track slippery art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds) all the way to Rome. They’re forced into an uneasy partnership due to some guff about three golden eggs that Cleopatra used to own and that Booth is trying to steal. He almost manages to nab the first but Hartley intervenes and sends him to a remote Russian jail, a jail where he himself then ends up after he’s framed for stealing the egg by The Bishop (Gadot), another art thief eager to own them for herself. Hartley and Booth then decide to team up and take her down. The megabucks assembly of A-listers (each received a reported $20m for the film) might make sense in a boardroom – combined they have a reach of almost 400 million Instagram followers and their films have made over $20bn at the global box office – but there’s a vast, vibe-killing gap between what makes sense on paper and what works on screen. For a frippery such as this to fly, sky-high star power is as integral as bombastic set pieces but there’s a total lack of connective chemistry between the trio, each ill-suited to their role and the territory. It’s the worst, most removed algorithmic casting possible (even in Thurber’s ho-hum action comedy Central Intelligence, there was a spark between Johnson and co-star Kevin Hart) and watching the three on-screen makes for an overwhelmingly flat experience. Anything sexy is made asexual, anything charming is made charmless and so what should be a smooth ride is turned into a bumpy slog. The rat-a-tat back-and-forth between sworn enemies turned begrudging buddies Johnson and Reynolds is strikingly, embarrassingly unfunny and rapidly grating, thanks mostly to a spectacularly annoying turn from the latter, reheating his Deadpool and Free Guy shtick but with even less effective writing to play with. The dated pop culture references (Jurassic Park? Pulp Fiction? A Borat impression?) are as tiresome as the many schoolyard gay jokes and while one can understand the monetary appeal for them both, it feels like a career regression, remixing former glories rather than doing anything fresh. Gadot is not much help either, in a much smaller role, failing to bring any of the vampy fun required, sleepwalking through the motions, adept only when fighting. The nonsensically convoluted plot would perhaps be more forgivable if the stars were charismatic enough or the action were exciting enough but in a desperate search for something to squeeze enjoyment out of, it’s left to the locations to pick up the slack, the one good use of the film’s monstrous budget, whisking us around the world for some nice scenery while everything around it crumbles. There’s something so soulless and ineffectual about the aggressively unnecessary Red Notice that it almost plays like a pastiche of a Hollywood blockbuster, like a bot consumed the last 20 years of studio fare and spat out a facsimile as an experiment. No one expects films like this to change the game but, at the very least, they should be able to play it.",CEC_Doc10_RedNotice,CEC,Comedy,Negative,Red_Notice
60,JJC_Doc1_KingOfStatenIsland,"I’d never laid eyes on Pete Davidson before, nor have I ever set foot on Staten Island in all the time I’ve spent in New York City; nobody has ever remotely recommended it, although I must say that one scene in The King of Staten Island shot at the local minor league baseball park affords so spectacular a view of Manhattan across the water beyond centerfield that I may have to take in a game there next time I’m in town. Happily, the distant scenery is not all Judd Apatow’s new film has going for it, far from it. The director’s first film since Trainwreck five years ago, written by him along with Davidson and Dave Sirus, has the solid lived-in feel of a working class community in which everyone not only knows each other but pokes their noses into other people’s business and has to tolerate, shall we say, less than well-mannered behavior on the part of their relatives and neighbors. They’re rude, they’re slobs, they’re layabouts, they’re no-accounts and they all speak in clichés as if they’ve learned their entire vocabularies from watching TV. It’s a film full of characters who have to say “I’m sorry” a lot. Bottom line, though–they’re all quite recognizably and vibrantly human. Being an Apatow film also means that the people on view for an excessive 136 minutes are, for the most part, compulsively disputatious and often very funny. The “king” in question is Davidson’s Scott Carlin, a 24-year-old, heavily tatted lay-about who lives with mom Margie (Marissa Tomei) and sister Claire (Maude Apatow, the director’s 22-year-old daughter) in a cramped suburban-style house. Fireman Dad died on the job on 9/11. Scott’s ambitions soar no higher than becoming an apprentice at a tattoo parlor; any thoughts of going to college are quashed by an old guy who warns him that Jimmy Hoffa, Bill Cosby and Donald Trump, among others, all partook of higher education. It takes a little getting used to Scott; none-too-bright, he’s a slob, almost always contrary or uncooperative, has an excuse for everything and dares to profess no ambition. When he admits that, “I think I’m just stupid,” one can think of no reason not to agree, although he does emit a certain sweetness that bubbles up through the cracks every now and then. And he does make his sort-of girlfriend Kelsey (Bel Powley) happy in the sack. Satisfaction of that nature has not been the case for Margie for 17 years until she meets Ray (Bill Burr), a lively straight-shooter who is—what else?—a fireman. Combustion between them is such that it’s soon suggested that Scott should move out and get his own place, triggering a reaction from him perfectly appropriate to 12-year-old. When the young man later loudly and proudly proclaims, “We are the millennials!,” you fear for the future of the very world. This crisis does serve to switch the film’s momentum from first to second gear, but Apatow shows little concern for picking up the pace; reveling in characters’ reactions to the succession of spitballs life relentlessly aims at them seems to please the director more than anything. Dominating all are passages that exist mainly to provide the characters (and actors) an excuse to react in a variety of squirmy, embarrassing, uncomfortable, misguided and downright idiotic ways to events they—often misguidedly—wade into neck-deep. Among these mini-set pieces are a botched tattooing job and, more consequentially, a thoroughly idiotic nocturnal robbery of a drugstore that finally forces a smidgen of life reckoning upon Scott. Facing life’s realities is not something that comes naturally or remotely comfortably to this full-grown little kid, and the film is not so corny as to have him suddenly see the light. Well, he does, but not without heavy squinting. As many comically-minded creators do, Apatow likes to put his characters in awkward elemental situations, watch them stew, then stir the pot himself as needed; any number of scenes could be compactly described as situation comedy set-pieces. Davidson gets the brunt of this but proves fully up to the task as his character’s life begins spinning more quickly while drawing ever-closer to the drain. A big challenge in improv, however, is knowing how to accelerate toward an ending and wrap things up before it all turns into too much of a good thing, and it’s here that Apatow has failed to be ruthless enough; Staten Island would have been better in all respects with 20-25 minutes removed, footage that could then conveniently packaged with other extras. On the other hand, with a theatrical release being forcibly bypassed by Universal due to the enduring pandemic that has kept theaters closed, viewers’ ability to pause the action and dip in and out of the film will minimize the importance of the extended running time. As obnoxious, ill-mannered and downright stupid as the central character is, Davidson holds the screen in strong enough fashion to suggest good potential going forward. Tomei surges back to top feisty form here, and especially fine is Powley as a young woman trying to order her priorities. The King of Staten Island was meant to have had its world premiere at the South by Southwest Festival in March, followed by a New York bow at Tribeca. It most certainly would have brought down the house on both occasions.",JJC_Doc1_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Positive,KingOfStatenIsland
61,JJC_Doc2_KingOfStatenIsland,"Pete Davidson has never shied away from sharing personal details in his comedy routines. He goes one further on The King Of Staten Island, which he co-wrote with Judd Apatow and Dave Sirus, crafting an alternate reality story out of his roots. What would have happened to him had he not found comedy to help him through life, it asks. Like Davidson, Scott Carlin is still living with his mother Margie (Marisa Tomei) in their Staten Island home. He’s 24 and floundering, a position made all the more obvious when his little sister Claire (Maude Apatow) flees the island for uni. He’s set on becoming a tattoo artist and opening the world’s first tattoo restaurant (“Ruby Tattoosdays”, as he plans to call it), but even his best friends are getting weary of him practising his inking on them – Richie (Lou Wilson) is particularly unimpressed with the portrait of Obama permanently etched into his arm, where the former president looks like he’s decaying. Scott’s struggles stem from the death of his firefighter father, who – like Davidson’s own dad – died when he was seven years old. When his friends crack jokes about his passing, Scott pretends to laugh along, but he’s clearly not entirely behind them. Later, his mum returns to the dating scene for the first time in 17 years. But when Scott learns his mother’s new man is also a fireman (Ray, played by Bill Burr), he goes from cheekily telling her he hopes she “gets banged out real good” to throwing a teenager-sized tantrum. “She can’t marry the first man she’s been with since dad,” he tells Claire later when trying to persuade her to help him split them up. “She’s gotta peruse some dick.” Eventually, though, as Margie gets fed up with her son’s childish behaviour, Scott finds himself with nowhere to turn but Ray’s fire station. It’s there, surrounded by those in the same profession as his dad (and some who used to work with him, like Steve Buscemi’s Papa), that he finally begins to come to terms with the job they do and make peace with his dad’s premature death. At two-and-a-quarter hours long, The King Of Staten Island could do with a little trim – some sections, like the family visit to Claire’s college, drag a little – but, for the most part, it’s a heartwarming, hilarious watch. That the subject matter is so close to Davidson’s life makes it all the more affecting – when he joins Ray and his colleagues at a Staten Island Yankees game only to rant about the selfishness of firefighters having children, you can’t help but feel the rawness and real pain behind his words. Davidson has quietly been proving that he’s a great actor for some time now, with roles in quirky comedies like Big Time Adolescence and Set It Up. The King Of Staten Island is the most concrete evidence of his talent yet, making you laugh with him (and at him) as he haplessly flails his way out of arrested development and towards something resembling real adulthood. Whether his next steps keep up the semi-autobiographical approach or not, this movie makes the prospect of yet more movies from Davidson (he’s already signed up for James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad) even more tantalising.",JJC_Doc2_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Positive,KingOfStatenIsland
62,JJC_Doc3_KingOfStatenIsland,"In “The King of Staten Island,” Pete Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a 24-year-old layabout who still lives with his mom, spends most of his time smoking weed and playing video games with his friends, and nurses a wildly misguided dream to open a place called Ruby Tat-Tuesdays, where customers can watch each other get inked while scarfing down their chicken fingers. It’s a surpassingly yucky punchline in a movie that glories in the most ungainly aspects of fleshy human life. The tattoos Scott gives his friends for practice are blurry, misshapen blobs; Ray (Bill Burr), a well-meaning firefighter who angrily shows up after Scott tries to give his 9-year-old son a tattoo, has the pasty, unripped physique of a typical outer-borough working stiff. Even Scott himself has the kind of pale, waxy exterior that suggests the world’s worst hangover. But as “The King of Staten Island” gets underway, the source of Scott’s stagnation becomes clearer, as do the reasons for a personality that is alternately irritating, childishly impulsive and wildly self-centered. And what at first seems ugly and indulgent begins to take on weird beauty. There are sequences when Scott and his buddies hanging out and talking about nothing look like another version of the dude-centric hangout movies that director Judd Apatow has become famous for. But here, Apatow — working from a script he co-wrote with Davidson and Dave Sirus — pumps the brakes on raunchy jokes and obvious sight gags, allowing the humor and pathos of Scott’s story to coexist in unforced, organic harmony. The story of “The King of Staten Island” occurs over the course of early autumn, when Scott’s sister, Claire (Maude Apatow), moves out to attend college and he is left with his mom, Margie (Marisa Tomei), an overworked nurse who tries repeatedly to connect with her son, only to be insensitively rebuffed. Over the course of this ambling, unhurried narrative, Scott gets a job, fends off the attentions of his would-be girlfriend (Bel Powley laying on the Brooklyn accent with a trowel) and works up an irrational dislike for Ray, who works at a local firehouse. Scott’s own father was a firefighter and lost his life 17 years earlier, while on the job. On its face, “The King of Staten Island” may look like a thwarted, entitled young man getting his act together, but it gains momentum to become a portrait of trauma and unresolved grief. Davidson, best known for his work on “Saturday Night Live,” delivers a powerful central performance here, made all the more poignant for the movie’s autobiographical elements (his own father, also a firefighter, died on Sept. 11, 2001). But that real-world connection is never exploited or sentimentalized in “The King of Staten Island,” which is both irreverent and unexpectedly tender. There aren’t all that many laugh-out-loud moments in this steadfastly low-key film (one notable exception having to do with the ring tones on Scott’s friends’ phones), but that is utterly to the advantage of a movie that knows better than to get pushy with its characters — and, by extension, the audience — when a gentle nudge will do. Perhaps the highest compliment one can pay Davidson, Apatow and their collaborators is that “The King of Staten Island” is probably the first movie in cinematic history to earn every single one of the audience’s tears at the sight of a disastrous back tattoo. May it be the last.",JJC_Doc3_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Positive,KingOfStatenIsland
63,JJC_Doc4_KingOfStatenIsland,"It’s clear that director Judd Apatow is comfortable collaborating with stand-up comedians on projects that contain at least some autobiographical details. The King of Staten Island represents his third such film, following in the wake of Funny People (Adam Sandler) and Trainwreck (Amy Schumer). This time around, the co-writer/star is Pete Davidson, who is content to use significant chunks of his past in developing the screen personality of his character, Scott Carlin. Even more so than Sandler and Schumer, Davidson blurs the lines, and the result is familiar Apatow: simultaneously funny and touching with elements of pathos to go along with the raunchiness. However, The King of Staten Island runs too long and, as result, it loses steam while chugging toward the ending. This is the belated coming-of-age story of 24 year-old Scott, a man-child stuck in a state of arrested development. Rootless, perpetually stoned, and entirely unconcerned about the future, Scott drifts through life. He still lives with his mother, Margie (Marisa Tomei); has a barely civil relationship with his younger sister, Claire (Maude Apatow), who’s off to college; and is enjoying a friends-with-benefits situation with his longtime gal-pal, Kelsey (Bel Powley). Scott’s dream job is to create the first tattoo bistro (get a tat and a meal at the same time) but he lacks the ambition to do anything to get it started. His friends – Oscar (Ricky Velez), Igor (Moises Arias), and Richie (Lou Wilson) – are no better positioned in life and, as a result, function as enablers. Scott gets a shock to his system when his mother, a widow of 17 years, finds late-in-life love with fireman Ray Bishop (Bill Burr). Scott takes an instant dislike to Ray, in part because they get off on the wrong foot and in part because Scott can’t stand the idea of someone supplanting his long-dead father. He devotes himself to discrediting Ray and, although he succeeds, his actions have the unintended consequence of bringing himself down at the same time. The broad strokes of Scott’s background track with those of Davidson, who lost his firefighter father at age seven (he died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks) and lived most of his teenage and adult life as a rebellious, drug addicted outcast. Davidson, who has been candid about his past and his problems, has no difficulty inhabiting the uncomfortable interior of his prickly character. Scott isn’t always sympathetic (in fact, he’s quite often the opposite), but he feels real (as opposed to a screenwriter’s construct). None of the film’s secondary characters are as effectively realized but, because Davidson’s portrayal is so arresting, it rarely matters. Although it contains some painful scenes and dramatic moments – one of the most effective has Scott arguing about why firefighters shouldn’t have families – The King of Staten Island is a comedy. As such, it serves up its share of laugh-out-loud moments. The movie opens with a dissection of The Purge. Later, when discussing the reputation of Staten Island (where the movie transpires), one character remarks: “We’re the only place that New Jersey looks down on.” And, in describing Scott’s thin, unhealthy appearance, his sister remarks that he looks like an “anorexic panda.” One key ingredient that separates Apatow’s films from other comedies is the grounded nature of his characters and situations. Instead of creating over-the-top scenes and scenarios designed exclusively for their comedic potential, Apatow prefers to tether his humor to believable, relatable instances. He works hard to develop characters and say something of substance. It works better in some films than in others but none of his films, even the least appealing (in my opinion, that would be Funny People), is devoid of laugh-generating moments. Apatow has been instrumental in the development of Davidson’s career; an appearance by the comedian in Trainwreck indirectly led to Davidson’s SNL appearances. It unsurprising, therefore, that the two work effectively together. As he is wont to do, Apatow allows his lead to personalize the character in both the writing and acting stage; it’s difficult to envision anyone else playing Scott other than Davidson (although, with a little imagination, Sandler might be able to fill in – it’s interesting how similar aspects of their public personalities are). Pre-release interest in The King of Staten Island was strong. It was due to play at both the 2020 SXSW Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival before circumstances forced the cancelations of both events. Rather than delay the movie’s opening, Universal elected to release it as a PVOD choice, making it one of the most high-profile titles to open exclusively into the home video market. Its pedigree is undeniable and it offers a strangely nostalgic reminder of what a real movie is like. The King of Staten Island checks a lot of boxes and is worth the price of a rental for anyone longing for a more complete entertainment experience than what most VOD movies offer.",JJC_Doc4_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Positive,KingOfStatenIsland
64,JJC_Doc5_KingOfStatenIsland,"On the face of it The King of Staten Island tells a tale so familiar it's a cliché. A young man is struggling to come to terms with adult life. He smokes a lot of weed, hangs out with a crew of equally lost souls, and starts making some ill-advised life decisions. He's not an inherently bad lad: he loves his mum, he's nice to kids (mostly), and routinely disarms with his self-deprecating charms. You know this story, you know this person. If you're like me, it was you. Or, is you. Or, your brother. Or, one of your friends, or one of your children, or one of your friend's children, or one of your children's friends. He is the Everyman in the male coming-of-age saga: a troubled, confused, angry, depressed, fragile dude looking for some direction and purpose - not that he'd ever admit it. There's a journey to be taken and that's the basis of the movie/book/play/song etc. And so it is with The King of Staten Island, a 135-minute easy-paced film directed by Judd Apatow, now available on-demand. It is not genre-busting, or genre-defining, or genre-bending - it is a middle-of-the-road genre staple. Except for one thing… Pete Davidson. Pete Davidson is the movie's star. He isn't middle-of-the-road. He's speeding along the charisma super-highway, turning heads with what looks like an old banger act but is in fact a finely-tuned, custom-made performance that not only brings the film alive, but gives it a heart and a soul. Whatever way you look at it, The King of Staten Island is his film. Or put another way, Pete Davidson is The King of Staten Island. The comedian and Saturday Night Live regular plays the lead role, he gives the stand-out performance, he co-wrote the script, and he has an executive producer credit. He was even born in Staten Island and still lives there, for goodness sake. And that's not all. Davidson plays Scott Carlin, a drifting 24-year old wannabe tattoo artist who has yet to come to terms with the death of his firefighter father, killed in the line of duty when our pot-head protagonist was a boy. Scott's mental health is poor. He smokes too many joints, he lives with his mum, and he has chronic gut issues. It is a biography that reads very close to Davidson's own life story (his firefighter father, also called Scott, died trying to save others as a 9/11 first responder).Not exactly a stretch for Davidson the actor, then. I imagine there weren't a lot of ""Hey, Judd, what's my motivation?"" type conversations between lead actor and director. But, maybe, playing a fictional role largely based on your own back story is far harder than taking on the role of a totally different character altogether. Pete Davidson is not Scott Carlin in the way that Larry David is a heightened version of himself in Curb Your Enthusiasm. And yet, anybody who knows Davidson's stand-up work will see similar traits: the low-status schtick, the poking fun but not being mean - or being mean and then apologising afterwards. The dry delivery, the ill-fitting clothes, the off-beat persona. These characteristics are all evident in Scott Carlin, too, but somehow Davidson manages to shape him in such a way that the fictional character becomes so vivid it obscures the identity of the man playing him. That's not an easy trick to pull off. Davidson does it with plenty of help from his friends. Fellow stand-up comic Bill Burr plays Ray Bishop, a straight-talking, shirt-tucked-in kinda guy, who provides a nicely weighted counter-point to Scott and his haphazard lifestyle. Ray has eyes for Margie (the excellent Marisa Tomei), the long-suffering mother of Scott and his preppy younger sister Claire (Maude Apatow). That's one love story. The other is between Scott and his girlfriend Kelsey, a young woman hell-bent on putting Staten Island on the hipster map. She is played by the British actress Bel Powley, who was one of the few good things about Apple TV's The Morning Show (buckle up, there's a second season on the way). She doesn't have many scenes, but those she is in are some of the best in the movie - there'll be an Oscar on her shelf one of these days. There is also a very welcome cameo-plus from Steve Buscemi as Papa the fire chief, and a short but memorable appearance by Machine Gun Kelly in the guise of a tattoo shop owner.",JJC_Doc5_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Positive,KingOfStatenIsland
65,JJC_Doc6_KingOfStatenIsland,"Even Pete Davidson’s lo-fi charms can’t energise this baggy, can-kicking Judd Apatow slacker-com. The opening scene of ‘The King of Staten Island’ finds Scott Carlin (Pete Davidson) barrelling down a highway, hip hop blasting from his car’s speakers as he abruptly closes his eyes and keeps his foot on the gas. A few seconds later, Carlin’s gaze returns to the road just in time to narrowly avoid a line of stopped traffic, leaving him shaken but unscathed and muttering ‘I’m sorry.’ The suicide attempt hints at an exploration of Davidson’s struggles with mental health, but it’s ultimately a red herring – a jarring kick-off to another overlong Judd Apatow dramedy that simply meanders from one semi-autobiographical beat to the next. Just like Adam Sandler played a stand-up past his prime in ‘Funny People’ and Amy Schumer embraced her unlucky-in-love persona in ‘Trainwreck’, under Apatow’s direction Davidson plays a thinly veiled version of himself: a twentysomething Staten Island stoner living in his mother’s basement, still grappling with the loss of his firefighter father, who died when he was a kid. But whereas Davidson found stand-up comedy and joined the cast of ‘Saturday Night Live’, Carlin is afraid to leave the safety of his perpetually hazy man cave. Instead, he sells pills with his buddies, jokes about opening a combination tattoo parlour and restaurant (‘Ruby Tattoos-day’s’) and admits, ‘There’s something wrong with me mentally, like, I’m not okay.’ After years spent dodging the responsibilities of adulthood, Carlin has his life upended when his younger sister (Maude Apatow) leaves for college and his mother (Marisa Tomei) begins dating Ray (Bill Burr), who just happens to be a firefighter. While Carlin clearly wants his mum to be happy, he’s resistant to her entering a relationship with another man who puts his life on the line, bluntly stating, ‘Look what happened last time.’ His contentious interactions with Ray don’t help the situation, leading his mother to issue an ultimatum: it’s time for Carlin to move out, get a job and start taking care of himself. Forced out of his comfort zone, Carlin churns through a variety of possible futures: he busses tables at a local pizzeria, pursues a tattoo parlour apprenticeship, becomes an accomplice to an attempted robbery, briefly entertains the idea of enrolling in college and cleans toilets at a Staten Island fire station. But by the time the credits roll, there’s still no clear indication of what path Carlin will take or, perhaps more importantly, how he’ll confront the lasting psychological toll of his father’s death.  Playing a more troubled variation of himself isn’t much of a stretch for Davidson, and there’s a likeability to his default underachieving bro persona that’s endearing, if not exactly captivating (much like his recent turn in ‘Big Time Adolescence’). He’s at his best when trading barbs with Apatow as his concerned sister or playing off the subtle warmth of Tomei, who solidifies herself as Hollywood’s go-to mom. It’s not until late in the film that Steve Buscemi – briefly featured in the role of a veteran fireman – steals the show with the film’s most heartfelt monologue, candidly reminiscing about Carlin’s father over drinks at an appropriately dingy Staten Island dive bar. Unfortunately, the talented cast and authentic locales aren’t enough to combat a sluggish script, filled with superfluous tangents that inflate the runtime past two hours. It doesn’t help that the film seems afraid to open up in any meaningful way about its main character’s mental health problems, which is surprising considering how candid Davidson has been about his own battles. Like a slacker resistant to efficiency or introspection ‘The King of Staten Island’ is content to coast, with Apatow overseeing an aimless story uncharacteristically light on laughs that ultimately proves to be a royal waste of time.",JJC_Doc6_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Negative,KingOfStatenIsland
66,JJC_Doc7_KingOfStatenIsland,"The opening scene of The King of Staten Island is not only the highlight of Judd Apatow’s latest act of indulgence, but also hints at something that the rest of the film never lives up to. It tracks Pete Davidson’s Scott as he drives on the highway, face scrunching up in frustration before he breathes in and closes his eyes. It’s cathartic and powerful in a way the film is not and, subsequently, never really tries to be. The film forgoes any real level of pathos for an even keeled story that flounders in the “just fine” territory. It’s tried and true Apatow – overlong, well meaning and allowing an up and coming talent to try and take the reigns of a film – though in this case, the star ends up dwarfed by heartfelt performances by the supporting players. Scott is a 20 something sunken into the pits of arrested development, watching as his younger sister goes to college and pseudo girlfriend begins to pursue her dreams outside of the Staten Island perimeter. His lifestyle is flipped on its head though when his mother, the wonderful Marissa Tomei, falls for a firefighter played with subtle humor and loud sincerity by Bill Burr. As the three try to cope with their new relationship dynamics and Scott deals with lingering feelings over the death of his father – also a fireman – they also must find what it is they want in life and what they’re willing to sacrifice to get it. But don’t let that synopsis mislead you. It is very much a strictly by the numbers, meat and potatoes style Apatow venture – though his lead is cast somewhat younger than what he might usually go for. Much of the film, as is the case with any comedy driven by the persona of the star, is in the hands of Davidson, a talent who is divisive to say the least. His story is undoubtedly profound – even if it’s a diluted version of it here – but unfortunately he never musters up the charisma the role calls for. There’s a haunted look to him – one that a toothy smile does much to try and hide – and it’s something that, in those opening seconds, proves to be beneficial in front of a camera because it’s at his most vulnerable and emotionally honest. There is a great performance lingering all of the easy height gags and shallow jokes, but it wasn’t intriguing enough for the writing team to dig deeper with. Luckily, we have Tomei and Burr to fill in the spaces with a genuinely lovely romantic comedy subplot. They court one another with leveled naturalism and a sweetness that overtakes the otherwise sharp screenplay by Davidson, Apatow and Dave Sirus. It’s so touching, so sweet of a story that it might’ve been better off had it taken the lead. This is especially true when we think of just how many films have already been made that focus on a son’s discontent with his mother’s new boyfriend. Tomei in particular is marvelous in a role that is so understated and full of warmth and laughter that it easily could have replaced Scott’s story and maybe would have made for a better picture overall. The romance is the core of the film, and the only reason this aimless film stays anchored is due to the work and magnetism of Tomei and Burr. While Davidson isn’t the most captivating leading man, much of the narrative disarray falls in the hands of Apatow, who has made it a habit of his to stretch a storyline too thin. This time around there’s a subplot where Scott gets a job as a busboy that needs to be entirely clipped out, a third act takes too long to arrive, and a climactic moment between Scott and his friends that nearly threatens to shake up the tone of a movie already struggling to stay grounded. There are more than a few moments of promise, including the aforementioned opening and the romance between Burr and Tomei, and heartwarming scenes such as an impromptu singalong in a dive bar that Scott takes part in with a bunch of local firemen who had just regaled him of his late father. It’s those moments of promise that make the general apathy The King of Staten Island inspired all the more frustrating. Like it’s protagonist, there’s charm to The King of Staten Island and it has its moments of biting honesty, but the film stalls as it takes too long to get out of its rudderless station and grab the reigns of its story.",JJC_Doc7_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Negative,KingOfStatenIsland
67,JJC_Doc8_KingOfStatenIsland,"Better Tagline: ""Pete Davidson is back. Too bad Judd Apatow's got him."" Not So Brief Plot Synopsis: High school dropout Scott Carlin's (Pete Davidson) life has been in something of a tailspin since the death of his firefighter father 17 years ago. He still lives with his mom, Margie (Marisa Tomei) and spends the bulk of his days smoking pot with his friends and dreaming of opening a ""tattoo restaurant."" But while he's treading water, his sister Claire (Maude Apatow) is heading to college. Meanwhile, more unwelcome news arrives in the form of Margie's new suitor, Ray (Bill Burr). ""Critical"" Analysis: Judd Apatow's films achieve some of their greatest impact when they focus on the interstitial periods in their characters' lives. The problem with his latest, The King of Staten Island, is how much time he spends there. When the first two-thirds of your movie dwell on awkward conversations and table setting, it's hard to engage when things finally start to move. As a star vehicle for SNL's Pete Davidson, TKOSI obviously depends on the young comedian to carry the weight. The extent to which you believe he succeeds will depend a lot on how much you like his shtick. The guy gets a lot of grief, some of it unwarranted (his personal life), some deserved (giving Dan Crenshaw a national stage), but the first 90 minutes are little more than Davidson playing himself, with all that entails. Fortunately, his co-stars step up in a big way. In stand-up comedian Burr's case, (maybe) surprisingly so. But Tomei is predictably great, and Steve Buscemi takes the reins in the third act as a veteran firefighter who knew Scott's dad, which helps guide this meandering ship to shore. Every Apatow movie is in some sense about the lead's arrested development, and you couldn't find a better poster child for that than Davidson. But is a 2 hour and 17 minute movie really required to chart Scott's personal growth? It's hard to emphasize this enough, but we spend an interminable amount of time ""getting to know"" Scott in a series of scenes that easily could've been cut in half. Maybe this wouldn't matter as much if ""before"" Scott wasn't A) a raging prick to his mother, and B) an indifferent asshole to his quasi-girlfriend Kelsey, all while meandering through life in a haze of bong smoke and self-pity. Less experienced filmmakers could have established these bona fides in half the time. Worst of all, The King of Staten Island just isn't that funny. Apatow has always found success with putting his main characters in improbably hilarious scenarios (the chest waxing in The 40-Year Old Virgin, etc.), TKOSI takes this to absurdity by presenting the restaurant where Scott buses tables as a place where staff is forced to fight each other for tips. Or maybe Staten Island is really as bad as What We Do in the Shadows suggests. The film's last act, in which Scott comes to terms with his father's legacy and his own issues, finally allows the character to mature and Davidson to sink his teeth into the role, but you have to wade through a nigh intolerable amount of self-indulgent bullshit to get there.",JJC_Doc8_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Negative,KingOfStatenIsland
68,JJC_Doc9_KingOfStatenIsland,"In ""The King of Staten Island,"" Pete Davidson plays a heavily tattooed manchild who's stuck in a suspended state of adolescence. He's mourning the loss of his firefighter father years earlier and lives with his mom in Staten Island, New York. It's the ""SNL"" star's story the same way ""8 Mile"" was Eminem's story; Em played a version of himself who was not really himself but okay, it was himself. We get it, we know what we're watching.  Yet director Judd Apatow, who co-wrote ""The King of Staten Island"" with Davidson and Dave Sirus, is never quite sure what to do with Davidson or how to tell his sort-of story, and the result is an oddly flat look at male bonding, deep psychological scarring and life inside the most looked down upon of New York's five boroughs.    Davidson plays Scott, a 24-year-old stoner who dresses in vintage hip-hop streetwear (it's only right the Wu-Tang Clan would receive several shout-outs in a Staten Island movie) and dreams of opening a restaurant-slash-tattoo parlor, which isn't a good idea to begin with but sounds even worse given present-world pandemic realities. The movie opens with Scott, who subsists on a steady diet of anti-depressants, driving down the highway, blasting Kid Cudi and tightly closing his eyes. When he opens them he nearly plows into stopped traffic, ending his life and those of a few others as well, and he swerves out of harm's way just in the nick of time.   ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry,"" he says to himself as he collects himself and drives off unharmed. And it's immediately clear that this Apatow tale will offer a different type of experience than his comedies ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" ""Knocked Up"" or ""Trainwreck,"" which take place in a decidedly real world context but favor outward laughs over probing examinations of internal anxieties.  So what exactly is ""The King of Staten Island?"" Like its star, it's a bit gangling. There are familiar beats with Scott and his group of friends hanging out, getting high, watching movies and goofing on each other, and true to movies like these, Scott has commitment issues with his kind-of girlfriend Kelsey (Bel Powley), and keeps their relationship a secret. But those matters — as well as an awkward heist subplot that is of so little consequence it could easily be lifted out of the film without making a ripple in the story — take a backseat to Scott's forced bonding with Ray (Bill Burr), a firefighter who starts dating his mother (Marisa Tomei). When Scott is kicked out of his house he goes to live with Ray at the firehouse, and he finally begins to sort through the feelings of loss and abandonment the death of his father left him with years ago. And at one point there's a cathartic singalong to the Wallflowers' ""One Headlight."" There are fragments of several different movies lying around the periphery of ""The King of Staten Island,"" but the story never truly comes together. Davidson, who turned in a similar performance in ""Big Time Adolescence"" earlier this year (and is frankly a bit old for coming-of-age stories), is consistently dwarfed by the dramatic demands of the role, and the script never manages to dial into the emotional torment of his character's internal struggles. And the laughs that would normally bail out a movie as at odds with itself as this one never arrive.  Within the scattered narrative, it's Powley's Kelsey who comes out the winner, and the most realized character in the film. Kelsey has a goal to get a job working for the city of Staten Island so she can shine a light on the positives of the area for all to see, and the Brit's performance is so grounded and rooted she could pass for a native of the Island. You feel her struggle and applaud her drive, and wind up rooting for her over anyone else. She's the queen of this world, it's the movie that's focused on the wrong member of the kingdom.

69,JJC_Doc10_KingOfStatenIsland,"Superbly Acted King of Staten Island a Royal Disappointment. My reaction to Judd Apatow’s latest men-behaving-badly and in dire need of psychological help dramatic comedy hybrid The King of Staten Island can be summed up in three simple words: I didn’t care. Even with a breakout performance from star Pete Davidson, even with strong support from the always wonderful Marisa Tomei, even with an award-worthy turn from veteran standup comedian Bill Burr, even with a final 40 minutes overflowing in honest human insight and intimately affecting emotional nuance, I never cared about much of what was happening. Apatow’s latest, even with some of the highest of highs that I’ve had the good fortune to see in 2020, still left me cold by the time it came to its suitably open-ended conclusion. Its issues and problems never sat well with me, while some of its more blatantly cartoonishly comedic subplots flat-out didn’t work. And while the two-plus hour length never bothered me, I equally can’t say the filmmaker was able to hold my rapt attention for every second of this 136-minute running time, its methodically-paced plotting only calling attention to the more distasteful aspects of the narrative that left a sour taste in my mouth. Twenty-something underachiever Scott Carlin (Davidson) still lives at home with his ER nurse mother Margie (Tomei) and his high school graduating with honors little sister Claire (Maude Apatow). Even though he has aspirations of owning a tattoo parlor and becoming known as a famous artist, in all honest Scott would rather hang out with his fellow slacker friends (Ricky Velez, Moises Arias and Lou Wilson) and smoke weed while playing video games. He’s also secretly sleeping with Kelsey (Bel Powley) but he’d like to keep their relationship a secret, not wanting anyone to know the two of them are potentially starting to form a romantic entanglement. After he attempts to give a child an impromptu tattoo, the kid’s (Luke David Blumm) understandably irate father, Ray (Burr), comes banging on Scott’s front door looking to pick a fight. But one thing leads to another, and events take an odd turn that catches everyone by surprise. Ray, father of two, recently divorced and a veteran New York firefighter, catches Margie’s eye, and before anyone knows what is going on the pair are dating, Scott not-so-secretly furious about what he sees as an utterly bizarre situation. There’s a great deal more to unpack. The core element driving events forward is the death of Scott’s father, also a New York firefighter, in the line of duty when he was still a child and before his sister had formed any memories of the man. He has never been able to get over his anger and his grief from this traumatic experience. It has also led Margie to become far too overprotective of her son, prone to let him get away with almost everything with zero repercussions. The insertion of Ray into the story is what forces everyone to reassess their lives, most notably Scott. My problem was, during the film’s first hour I just didn’t have any chips in the game. I found Scott to be a whiny nincompoop full of maudlin and insincere white male angsty rage that didn’t do a heck of a lot for me. His treatment of Kelsey turned my stomach and his refusal to take responsibility for his actions made me angry. Additionally, the trademark Apatow shifts in tone rarely worked, the jarring switch to juvenile slapstick comedy from hardcore drama not nearly as naturalistic or genuine as it was in some of the director’s past hits like did in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. But the cast kept eyes glued to the screen. Everyone bringd their A-game, delivering superior performances even when the material lets them down. Powley steals every scene she’s in. Tomei reminds us all that her My Cousin Vinny Oscar (and additional nominations for In the Bedroom and The Wrestler) was hardly a fluke. While I can’t say I appreciated their story arc that still doesn’t mean Velez, Arias and especially Wilson aren’t a joy to watch every time they’re up on the screen, while a relatively brief, albeit critically important supporting turn from Steve Buscemi is nothing less than sublime. A for Burr, the man blew me away, and if he were to somehow manage to land a Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance I can’t say I’d be anything resembling surprised. He’s that terrific. Davidson shocked me. I never knew he had something like this in him. He holds the screen with remarkable confidence, and the emotional transformation Scott goes through during the final act is nothing less than stunning. It’s all thanks the electrifying intensity of Davidson’s performance. He’s is marvelous, and there’s not much more that needs to be said on the matter. For reasons that I will not disclose, there is a point where Scott ends up residing at Ray’s firehouse. It is during this section where the film comes alive as it never had before that moment. Apatow’s writing becomes far more dynamic, while his juggling of the various comedic and dramatic elements is up to the high standards I’ve come to expect from the director. There’s a level of budding introspective insight that I felt had been previously missing, all of which allows the motion picture to find its footing and climax on a memorable high that almost makes me willing to forgive all of the elements I didn’t particularly care for. I’m having trouble doing it that, and as strong as the ending might be my dissatisfaction with the first hour isn’t vanishing. Thanks primarily to Davidson’s star-making turn I have a feeling most will be far more forgiving to Apatow’s latest than I will be. But for me, while an ambitious enterprise with royal aspirations to greatness, The King of Staten Island never earned its crown, and as such my fidelity to its ruling authority is practically nonexistent.",JJC_Doc10_KingOfStatenIsland,JJC,Comedy,Negative,KingOfStatenIsland
70,MLD_Doc1_Encanto,"We all feel that way at times. It seems like everyone has something special except for us. “Encanto,” the new animated film from Disney captures that imposter phenomenon with a story set in Columbia about a girl who is the only one in her family with no magical powers. It is colorful and exciting and funny and warm-hearted and, something harder to find, it is also wise. As we learn in one of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s bright, energetic songs early in the film, Mirabel (sweetly voiced by Stephanie Beatriz) loves her family and is very proud that her mother has healing powers and her aunt has superstrength. Other family members can understand animals, predict the future, or shape-shift. Mirabel’s sister’s superpower just seems to be perfection. The Madrigal family has a rich, storied history. When her grandparents were young, they fled their home. Her grandfather was killed by the people they were trying to escape. But her grandmother, clutching her baby, was blessed with the powers to help her community survive. A generation later, the family is the center of that now-settled community, living in a home with its own magical powers and personality. That house, communicating with flipping floor tiles and steps that slip into slides and creating dazzling new rooms to recognize each family member’s powers, is one of the movie’s highlights. The family has a ceremony when each member receives his or her magical powers. But for some reason, Mirabel’s never arrived. She even wears glasses (the first Disney lead character to do so) to show just how ordinary and relatable she is. Unexpectedly, the magic the family has counted on and taken pride in — and taken for granted — seems to begin to be dissolving. And that is when the girl who does not think she is special begins to understand that she, and only she, has the qualities the family needs to keep them together. That means adventure. It also means learning some lessons about how even the most loving, high-performing, and functional families have to deal with secrets and sometimes painful and scary truths. This insight is gently but thoughtfully explored, understanding that sometimes it is especially difficult to be honest with happy families for fear of letting the others down. But when family policy is “We don’t talk about Bruno,” it is time for someone to ask why. And when we do not leave room for family members to be less than perfect, it is time to tell them it is okay if they make mistakes and in fact if they don’t, it’s a good idea to tell them to make some. Families will enjoy “Encanto” but what may be more meaningful are the conversations we have afterward. Parents should know that this movie includes some fantasy peril and some difficult family struggles. Family discussion: Which magical power would you like to have? Why did one family member hide? How do you honor a miracle? If you like this, try: “Brave,” “Raya and the Last Dragon,” and “Moana”",MLD_Doc1_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Positive,Encanto
71,MLD_Doc2_Encanto,"Walt Disney’s 60th animation boasts songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda and a fine voice cast, but it’s hampered by contradictory messages and a lack of sparkle.  This musical, boasting a lively voice cast and original songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, has been promoted as the 60th “canonical” film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. But however well-meaning, this milestone movie could almost represent a creative crisis for Disney – it feels like yet another step down the cul-de-sac of bland, algorithmically generated entertainment: more Stepford content from the dream factory. There are some nice moments and sweet show tunes, but Encanto feels like it is aspiring to exactly that sort of bland frictionless perfection that the film itself is solemnly preaching against, with a contrived storyline that wants to have its metaphorical cake and eat it. Our heroine is Mirabel Madrigal: a smart, introspective, bespectacled teen living with her extended family in a magic house with a mind of its own in an idyllic village in a magically created valley somewhere in Colombia (“encanto” means enchantment or spell). She is voiced by Stephanie Beatriz, who recently had a small role in Miranda’s musical In the Heights but is probably still best known for playing the supercool tough cop Diaz in the TV comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Mirabel’s grandma is the formidable matriarch Abuela (voiced by María Cecilia Botero), who lost her husband many years ago, and for whom this magical house was mysteriously created at the time, apparently rising up in defiance of this great sadness. And all of her children and grandchildren turn out each to have a magic power, of which Abuela is intensely proud. Mirabel’s mum Julieta (Angie Cepeda) can heal people with her cooking, and I guess only a pedant would ask why she doesn’t heal Mirabel’s eyesight. Mirabel’s sister Isabella (Diane Guerrero) is a perfect Instagram-style princess who can make flowers bloom with her sheer loveliness. Her other sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) has super-strength and can lift buildings. Her aunt Pepa (Carolina Gaitán) can control the weather and cousin Dolores (Adassa) has super-hearing. This is a pretty heteronormative household but her cousin Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz) can shapeshift because he doesn’t know who he is yet. But wait. There is one person who doesn’t have a gift and that is poor Mirabel herself. Yet when a sudden, terrible crisis occurs and all the members of the Madrigal family look like losing their powers, it is Mirabel who must step up and save everyone and everything – by tracking down the family’s missing uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) whose own gift of prophecy allowed him to foresee this awful eventuality and Mirabel’s own part in the fightback. And … well … maybe this family of fanatical overachievers need to see how their supernatural superiority is a neurotic group symptom of unhappiness. Maybe they need humble Mirabel to bring them to a new enlightenment. So are their gifts a good thing or a bad thing? They didn’t seem like such a bad thing in the film’s opening two acts: these gifts seemed to be part of everyone’s innocent well-being, abilities lightly and modestly worn. And as the rescuing of these powers is the plot motivation, it is an uncomfortable turnaround for these powers to be represented as something to be opposed or surmounted – a paradox which the film does not acknowledge or resolve – especially as we get a pretty broad hint that they may in any case be magically restored. This is a flavourless, unsatisfying film.",MLD_Doc2_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Negative,Encanto
72,MLD_Doc3_Encanto,"The latest stop on Disney Animation Studios' world tour, following Raya and the Last Dragon's riff on Fantasy Asia earlier this year, is Colombia. The most famous work of art to come out of Colombia (and a strong contender for the designation of greatest novel ever written) is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, and the studio's new film Encanto pays homage to that magical realist masterwork with its story of a multi-generational family blessed by wonderful enchantments. It's hard to miss the rhyme between ""Encanto,"" which is both the title of the film and a word often used by its characters to refer to the miracle that made a home for them deep in the mountains, and ""Macondo,"" the town founded by Marquez's unforgettable Buendia family in the middle of the jungle. Of course, One Hundred Years of Solitude delves deeply into sex, politics, and the bloodstained history of imperialism in Latin America — none of which are quite suitable subjects for a Disney kids' movie. So for its structure and rhythm, Encanto leans on more familiar U.S. media touchstones. Like the X-Men, almost every member of the Madrigal family is blessed with their own unique power: Luisa (Jessica Darrow) is strong enough to lift anything, while Isabela (Diane Guerrero) can make beautiful flowers bloom all around her. But like The Umbrella Academy, the story of Encanto focuses on the only family member who doesn't have an evident superpower: Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz), the younger sister of Luisa and Isabela who desperately wants to prove she can support her family and community just as well as they can. Her lack of power seems to suggest that the family's enchantment is fading, so Mirabel decides to try investigating the source of this decline and see if it can be fixed. Maribel embarks on a search for her prodigal uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo), who exiled himself from the family after his precognitive visions were dismissed as self-fulfilling doomsaying instead of helpful warnings against coming troubles. Mirabel's quest to find the truth involves reaching out to various other family members for help as well. Through charming songs, we learn that Luisa is starting to crack under the pressure of always needing to be strong, while Isabela actually possesses the spirit of a colorful, rebel artist beneath her golden child facade. Encanto is directed by Byron Howard and Jared Bush, but the film's original songs were composed by Hamilton maestro Lin-Manuel Miranda. Together with Netflix's Vivo and Tick, Tick...Boom!, that makes Encanto the third film to heavily feature Miranda's touch in as many months (to say nothing of In the Heights earlier this year). It's no crime to be such a prolific artist, especially with COVID-19 delaying releases, but it also doesn't feel like the Encantosoundtrack is Miranda's best work. The songs are breezy and fun, they communicate the character beats they need to, but they probably won't be stuck in your head for days afterward.  It's not easy squeezing a multi-generational magical epic into an hour and a half, and some gaps in Encanto's mythology might leave you scratching your head (if it's true that Mirabel doesn't have a power of her own, then why does she seem to possess such a unique level of affinity and control over the family's living house…?). But a smiling tale about familial reconciliation and learning to see your relatives for who they are rather than who you wish they were is never unwelcome. In this story, sometimes families condemned to 100 years of solitude do get a second chance on Earth.",MLD_Doc3_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Positive,Encanto
73,MLD_Doc4_Encanto,"Despite my fervent hopes, Disney’s Encanto didn’t quite cast a spell on me. As much as I love movies about misfits who ultimately find their purpose, as fascinated as I am by Latin American cultures and as desperate as I am for a movie to transport me to a place I clearly will not be travelling to any time soon, I was disappointed. It’s odd, given the people involved, and the research that went into a solid idea. Co-director Byron Howard made Zootopia and Tangled, and Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote eight songs for the animated musical. A team travelled to Colombia in 2018 to get a feel of the location where the story is set. Encanto is centred around the idea of exploring the complexities within a multigenerational family. Although the movie is suffused with Colombian textures, adding punches of magic realism into the plot, the story is too confusing to take away any clear images or messages. A few days after watching it, I’m hard-pressed to remember a particular sequence that was breathtaking. I can’t even think of a standout Miranda song that captured my attention enough to hum a hook. Encanto opens with Mirabel Madrigal (Stephanie Beatriz) introducing us to her extended family. There’s the matriarch, Alma (Maria Cecilia Botero), lovingly called abuela (grandmother), Mirabel’s older siblings Luisa (the strong one) and Isabela (the perfect one with a floral touch), cousins Dolores (who hears everything), Camilo (the shape shifter) and Antonio (the one about to be blessed with a gift). Then there’s her mom and dad, aunt and uncles – and they all live together in the magical Madrigal casa. “But what is your gift?” the kids in the town ask Mirabel. Turns out, Mirabel doesn’t have a gift, which makes her an oddity within her family. She tries to make up for her perceived shortcomings by being a people pleaser. On the day that five-year-old Antonio takes part in the special ceremony meant to reveal his gift, Mirabel sees cracks in their magical house. When she tries to alert her family, they don’t pay her attention. In fact, her beloved abuela tells Mirabel to stay out of the way. However, Mirabel grows more certain of what she saw, and the repercussions it could have on her family’s powers. She sets out to unravel the mystery behind a vision her Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) experienced before he disappeared. Solving that mystery will help the Madrigals keep their magic alive. If the plot had stuck to the magical Madrigals and Mirabel as the odd-girl-out, together facing some kind of external challenge, it would have been an easier narrative to follow. But the filmmakers make the tension come from within this multigenerational family. And this is where things get confusing. There’s an origin story as to how the Madrigals got their magic, which has to do with a community exodus. Why this exodus happens, and how that results in the Madrigals receiving their gift, isn’t fully explained. And so there’s a lack of clarity when it comes to understanding the exact threat to the Madrigal clan. Why is the gift of magic too hard a cross for the Madrigals to bear? Why were they chosen in the first place? The questions kept me from being immersed in the narrative. This isn’t to say the story doesn’t move you in parts. There’s a warmth in Mirabel’s mother’s ability to heal through her food – that’s a gift many people can intimately understand. Despite those moments of affection, however, Encanto ends up being overwrought rather than enchanting.",MLD_Doc4_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Negative,Encanto
74,MLD_Doc5_Encanto,"The animation is a riot of colors wrapped around the graceful sway of South American dancers, some of the most glorious animated dance since Walt Disney’s “Fantasia.” “Encanto” is simply gorgeous to look at, almost from start to finish. But I didn’t care for the film, and I’ve been struggling to process the reasons for two weeks since seeing it, trying to hit on exactly where it seems lacking. Could it be Lin-Manuel Miranda fatigue? I haven’t been nuts about any screen musical he’s scored since “Hamilton.” And right from the jumbled, raced-through incoherence of the opening number, in which our heroine, Mirabel (voiced and sung by Stephanie Beatriz) is singing about her “Family Madrigal” at great speed because she doesn’t want to dwell on the fact that unlike every relative she’s named, she has no “miracle given to our family,” a “special gift,” the tunes are forgettable/forgotten before the notes have drifted off the soundtrack. Perhaps the patchwork, not-about-anything story (five credited writers contributed, two tried to wrestle it into a screenplay “plot”) hung me up. Dazzling voice casts don’t matter, and the Colombians, Colombian Americans and others represented here have to work with the script they were given. Just hiring someone who sounds like a matriarchal version of Salma Hayek seems a cheat. But it’s still Disney. Even when they miss they don’t often miss by much. Our story takes place in an unnamed corner of South America where somebody dies fleeing violence in a river crossing. Disney says that it’s “Colombia,” so why not? Like “Raya,” the culture celebrated here is more vague than simply defined. They’ll fix that with a press release. Again. Mirabel and the Madrigal family live in an enchanted villa on the outskirts of a quaint town where the locals rely on their generosity and their “gifts.”  Sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) is super strong, and sister Isabella (Diane Guerrero) is so “perfect” that she makes flowers bloom and trails blossoms where ere she goes. Mirabel’s firing blanks. There are also “gifted” aunts and a shape-shifting uncle (Wilmer Valderamma), cousins, nieces and nephews and a matriarchal Abuela – “grandmother” (María Cecilia Botero) who keeps traditions and family lore alive in their magical, helpful house where the table sets itself and the moment you see the prancing, dancing alarm clock you know where they got that idea from. Vague events conspire to make Mirabel’s missing gift stand out and cause the house to lose its luster and magic. Her relatives start losing their “gift.” She must sift through family history, poke around the many rooms behind each gifted family member’s illuminated door to find a way to save them, perhaps one involving the missing uncle she’s never met, Bruno. Is she “just as special as the rest of us” or is her special gift problem solving? Because maybe she could take a pass at the screenplay, if that’s the case. The clutter of characters gives away a certain “Let’s just add more” flavor to the screenplay’s problem-solving. Let’s introduce a toucan sidekick for Mirabel’s “Heroine’s Journey,” and uh, decide we’re not going to do the usual Disney things with him. And that’s typical. Some trippy visuals on that journey and the best efforts of funnyman John Leguizamo along the way don’t produce anything that I’d call a laugh. A few sight-gags with the muscle-sis and shape-shifting uncle just lie there. Maybe this will play to the very youngest audience, but that’s what we say about animation that’s not anything anyone over eight will get much out of. I found “Encanto” more aggravating than entertaining, felt I learned nothing about the culture Disney says it’s celebrating and felt the dread welling up for Lin-Manuel’s work in the upcoming “tick…tick…BOOM.” Disney’s “Coco” and Netflix’s “Vivo” had it all over “Encanto” in terms of story, heart, gags and music. This film looks finished but plays as “We’re still working story kinks out.”",MLD_Doc5_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Negative,Encanto
75,MLD_Doc6_Encanto,"Finding something the whole family can watch during the holidays is a perennial challenge. It’s as much a part of tradition as turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas carols on the radio soon after. This holiday season, Disney is serving up a warm, feel-good family friendly movie called “Encanto,” a Colombian magical realist tale of a family that received special powers after surviving a tragedy. Now, a few generations later, they live together in a magical house and each member develops their own talent, like the ability to control the weather, shapeshift into other people, and talk to animals. Their casita (house) responds to the family’s requests and responds to their moods. Each bedroom is magically tailored to the relative and their magical gift. All except for one, Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz). Encanto” follows the “girl with no apparent gift” Mirabel, who tries her best to fit in a family so extraordinary that her judgmental Abuela Alma (María Cecilia Botero) offers only her disappointment at every turn. For Mirabel, it’s tough to stand out when her mom, Julieta (Angie Cepeda), can heal wounds with her cooking—more specifically, her arepas con queso, her sister Luisa (Jessica Darrow) can lift the heaviest of objects with ease, and her sister Isabela (Diane Guerrero) can grow the most beautiful flowers without barely thinking about it. Mirabel notices the family’s casita is starting to show cracks, but no one believes her and downplays her worries as something her estranged eccentric uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) would say. It’s up to Mirabel to find out what’s happening to save both her family and her home. Directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard (“Zootopia”) and co-director Charise Castro Smith (”Raya and the Last Dragon”), who bears more than a passing resemblance to the movie’s main character, have created another kind hearted movie about misfits trying to do the right thing. Most notably, there’s no villain in this Disney movie, just a nebulous “unknown” threatening the family and their home. The conflict is minimal at best, which allows for Mirabel to spend more time learning about what she can do despite her lack of powers, but it also leaves the movie feeling a bit meandering. To make up for lost action, the movie shines in its animation and design, really making use of the house with doors to new worlds and musical sequences that allow for a little more abstract artistic freedom. Speaking of those musical sequences, I think it’s time Lin-Manuel Miranda takes a break. After knocking it out of the park with “In the Heights,” “Hamilton” and “Moana,” his 2021 offerings have been a little lackluster. For this review, I finally watched the movie “Vivo,” in which he voices the title character as well as handles the song writing duties. Those numbers sounded flimsy and forgettable. In one song, he rhymes “drum” with… “drum.” In “Encanto,” the odds are a little better, more songs fare better than others, but there’s still a sense that these musical numbers are the reheated leftovers from other projects. They sound like his work, but don’t offer anything new or exciting to get stuck in our heads. Isabela and Luisa’s disposable pop songs ""What Else Can I Do?"" and ""Surface Pressure"" are cloyingly repetitive. “The Family Madrigal” is a less effective version of the opening song from “In the Heights.” Only Carlos Vives’ rendition of Miranda’s song ""Colombia, Mi Encanto"" sounds like a memorable stand-out. Unimpressive songs are an unfortunate thing to befall an animated musical like “Encanto.” Thankfully, there are other elements to enjoy like the movie’s boisterous voice cast that includes Carolina Gaitán, Rhenzy Feliz, Ravi Cabot-Conyers, Wilmer Valderrama, Mauro Castillo, and one-name Latin music stars Maluma and Adassa. It’s also impressive to see an animated Disney movie finally include varying skin tones and hair textures in the same family, while also incorporating Colombian fashion like ponchos, flowing embroidered skirts, colorful dresses and guayaberas as part of a character’s details. Beatriz is magnificent as Mirabel, embodying both pain and love in her voice throughout the film, yet never losing a sense of the goofy playfulness that makes her character so likeable. Abuela’s singing voice comes from the one and only Olga Merediz, another “In the Heights” alum. Similar to how Pixar’s “Coco” paid tribute to Mexican culture, “Encanto” holds many nods to its Colombian roots, from the use of flowers and animals specific to the regions to crafting songs that incorporated their respective countries’ musical palette. In both stories, the matriarchal abuelas have to also go through an emotional journey just as much (if not more) than the younger protagonists in the movie. It’s an interesting development to see both Pixar and Disney Animation move into the world tour phase of their storytelling, but I hope they avoid repeating each other in thematic and narrative elements. 
One difference is that “Encanto” explores the Madrigals’ backstory beyond their household, showing the Madrigal grandparents fleeing their homeland for safety and Abuelo’s ultimate sacrifice in an artistic flashback. The story of a homeland lost and the family who rebuilt in a new land is not an uncommon one for many immigrant families, and by sensitively including it as part of a charming Disney movie, perhaps will give a new generation a better sense of belonging or at least the comfort that others have shared their experience. It may help kids who didn’t grow up with those stories of a “paradise lost” to understand those that did. Maybe that’s an optimistic view for a movie many will flock to in a post-turkey coma, but despite a few missteps, “Encanto” is one of the more charming animated movies to hit theaters this year.

76,MLD_Doc7_Encanto,"Disney’s Encanto is, well, enchanting. It’s tricky to make an animated film so infused with exuberant sweetness without it becoming cloying. But this whimsical dose of magic realism set amid the lush greenery of the Colombian mountains benefits as much from the purity of the storytelling as the stunning vibrancy of the visuals. Aside from a quick nod to the inescapable Frozenanthem, “Let It Go,” and a funny throwaway gag about valet parking for burros, there are remarkably few of the usual winking cultural anachronisms designed to pander to contemporary kids. Instead, this is a film that commits to the timeless folklore of its South American setting to a transporting degree. The project is led by two of the directors behind Zootopia, Jared Bush and Byron Howard, with co-direction from lead screenwriter Charise Castro Smith, a playwright making an impressive leap into features after TV credits ranging from Devious Maids to The Haunting of Hill House. The other indispensable member of the creative team is Lin-Manuel Miranda, who contributes eight buoyant original songs that blend his passion for traditional musical theater with Colombian music and the rapid-fire wordplay of hip-hop. The opening number does exactly what a good musical starter should do — it deftly sets the tone, maps out the history and breakdown of the large gallery of characters, and zooms in on the principal figure, Mirabel Madrigal. Voiced with delightful verve by Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine), the 15-year-old is a beloved member of the extended family but also something of an outsider, who hides her melancholy feelings of inferiority by being a model of cheery helpfulness. That same song, “The Family Madrigal,” also introduces their casita, a multistory fairy-tale house with its own magical powers. Its roof and floor tiles, doors and windows all move in rhythm with the music, communicating with the Madrigals in inventive ways and nudging the physical comedy. Mirabel’s grandmother, Abuela Alma (María Cecilia Botero), has the warmth of the classic salt-of-the-earth matriarch but also a watchful sternness. She is literally the keeper of the flame, a candle delivered to her in a time of tragedy that burns eternally, fueling the family’s magic. Forced to flee her native village with three newborn infants, Alma lost her husband, Pedro, in an attack by bandits. The candle caused the Madrigal house to appear out of uninhabited jungle and has granted a special gift to all Alma’s children and grandchildren ever since, revealed on each one’s fifth birthday. Mirabel’s mother, Julieta (Angie Cepeda), can heal any illness with her cooking; her sister Isabela (Diane Guererro) is a dazzling beauty who makes flowers bloom; eldest sibling Luisa (Jessica Darrow) possesses superhuman strength; Aunt Pepa (Carolina Gaitán) can control the weather with her feelings; cousin Dolores (Adassa) has extraordinary hearing; and another cousin, Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz), is an irrepressible entertainer with shape-shifting powers. Only Mirabel has no gift. The anticlimax of her fifth birthday celebration, when the magical doorway with her name on it simply crumbled to dust, still weighs heavily on her 10 years later. On her Abuela too, especially with the gift ceremony of Mirabel’s young cousin Antonio (Ravi Cabot-Conyers) fast approaching. Alma is concerned that the magic — which has cocooned the family for three generations and supported the village community that sprung up around them — may be burning out. When Mirabel has a vision of the enchanted casita cracking up, she fears the worst, her apprehension shared by Abuela and by Luisa, who begins to find her Herculean feats an effort. She reveals the unsuspected vulnerability beneath her mighty strength in the song, “Surface Pressure,” another standout. Feeling that her lack of a gift has let the family down — and in need of some uplifting self-validation, in accordance with the Disney rulebook — Mirabel takes it upon herself to investigate what’s jeopardizing the magic, a quest that takes her through hidden passages and vast chambers inside the walls of the house to track down her mysterious Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo), who disappeared years earlier. Much of the movie’s considerable charm comes from the fact that despite the magical elements inherent even in its title, the story is basically about the dynamics of any large, close-knit family of contrasting personalities. The majority of the Madrigals’ gifts correspond to qualities often found among more ordinary mortals — the tradition-bound grandmother; the nurturing mother; the impossibly pretty golden-child sister (whose mean-girl attitude is frequently directed at Mirabel); and the selfless, hardworking older sibling, burdened by a sense of responsibility. Mirabel is basically any teenager perceived as unexceptional, who really just wants to be seen and acknowledged for her own special traits.
The characters who have married into the family are equally recognizable types: Mirabel’s father, Agustín (Wilmer Valderrama), is a lovably clumsy dad who dotes on all the women that dominate the household; and there’s a life-of-the-party uncle like Pepa’s husband, Félix (Mauro Castillo), in every family. As much as the story hinges on Mirabel discovering what threatens the Madrigal magic and endangers their refuge, on a more fundamental level it’s about this big, complicated group reestablishing its harmony, learning to appreciate, even celebrate, one another’s qualities, whether they are extravagant or simple. And it’s about a community coming together to rebuild what’s lost and fortify one another in the process. Those sentiments are expertly drawn out by the excellent voice cast and evoked in Miranda’s flavorful songs, including two numbers written in Spanish: “Dos Oruguitas,” performed by Colombian singer-songwriter Sebastián Yatra, is a soulful allegorical retelling of the love story between Abuela Alma and her late husband; and “Colombia, Mi Encanto” is a stirring homeland salute sung by national pop superstar Carlos Vives. In a nice touch of artistic continuity, Alma’s singing voice is provided by Miranda’s In the Heights Abuela, Olga Merediz.
The film continues Disney’s reach for more diverse representation in its animated features, following recent titles Moana, Raya and the Last Dragon and Pixar’s Coco, which shares a Latin American setting but is entirely different in its distinctly Mexican sensibility. The colors of Encanto are sumptuous, as is the marvelous detail in the costumes and production design, nowhere more so than the Madrigals’ truly animated house — a merchandizing opportunity waiting to happen. The natural settings are even more beautiful, notably a river fed by cascades where Abuela takes Mirabel to share her story. And the animal life that’s so much a part of the classic Disney toon is not neglected, with a cheeky toucan “voiced” by Alan Tudyk and a whole menagerie that appears in connection to one character’s gift, including a jaguar, tapirs, capybaras, even cute rats. Luisa’s rounding up of the wandering donkeys gets big laughs. Disney clearly recognizes the potential to reach family audiences over the holidays with this Thanksgiving release; the touching, tender but ultimately joyous story is going the theatrical route, with a Disney+ premiere to follow in December. Encanto is ideally paired with Far From the Tree, a lovely seven-minute short, written and directed by Natalie Nourigat, which mirrors the feature’s themes of family and the safety of home in its captivating story of a strict but loving raccoon parent struggling to keep its curious offspring from harm.",MLD_Doc7_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Positive,Encanto
77,MLD_Doc8_Encanto,"Could Walt Disney’s 60th animated feature, “Encanto,” be its first to be nominated for a best picture Oscar since 1991’s “Beauty and the Beast”?
Well, 2021 is emerging as one of the best years for film in recent memory, so probably not — and Disney’s spring offering “Raya and the Last Dragon” is no slouch either — but don’t count it out. “Encanto,” which opens in theaters Wednesday, Nov. 24, is 99 minutes of pure bliss, a story about how weaknesses can be strengths, strengths can be weaknesses, and how love and determination are far better than magic when it comes to healing a broken family. Every character, even minor ones, is well thought out and cast; the eye-popping visual design is not only inspired and mesmerizing but also functional; and memorable songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda and others complement the story perfectly. The prologue explains how the members of the Madrigal family came to be hermetically sealed in their own private, magical kingdom: Decades ago, while trying to emigrate from Colombia, Abuela (voice of María Cecilia Botero), her husband and their three infant children are trapped by border patrol agents on horseback. Her husband is killed, but Abuela and the kids are saved by a magical flower that sparkles and grows into a lush, tropical small town protected by surrounding mountains. Decades later, Abuela is the matriarch of a large and mostly harmonious family, and each is blessed with a specific magical power. Among Abuela’s daughters, Julieta (Angie Cepeda) can heal, both physically and emotionally, through her cooking; and Aunt Pepa (Carolina Gaitán) can make it rain, often, comically, over her own head. Among the grandchildren, Luisa (Jessica Darrow) has Supergirl-level strength; the beautiful but vain Isa (Diane Guerrero) can make colorful flowers bloom at a touch (perhaps a subconscious parody of the “Disney princess”); and Camilo (Rhenzy Feliz) can morph into any person. But there’s one granddaughter who inexplicably never received a gift. Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz), maybe not so coincidentally the sweetest and nicest of the bunch, is a girl who never judges and seeks to find her own way to contribute to a family that seems to have everything. hey all live in this amazing, huge house that is a character in and of itself. It is alive, it provides the magic and assists the family it clearly loves, such as helping them get on their shoes, out the door and down the stairs — its tile floors flowing and flipping like falling dominoes in a triumph of animation and design. (Ian Gooding is credited as production designer, Mehrdad Isvandi is art director of environments, and Camille Andre is art director of characters.) The drama begins when the house literally begins to crack up, and family members start to lose their magic — and with it their self-esteem. The emotional cracks in the Madrigal family also appear. Abuela is perhaps too controlling, and the magic gifts in her children and grandchildren have come to be burdens, limiting their growth. Have the Madrigals become too complacent in their magic kingdom? Why does the blame always fall on Mirabel? And what does Mirabel’s exiled uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo) have to do with it? It’s possible to see “Encanto” — directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, and co-directed by Charise Castro Smith — as a rebuke to the heroes of franchise tentpoles who were born with physical superpowers. From the endless array of Marvel and DC characters who shoot fireballs from their hands or lasers from their eyes to Jedi knights in “Star Wars” who are magically born with the Force inside them to — yes — Disney heroines such as Mulan, whose gravity-defying fighting skills were gifted at birth rather than earned the old-fashioned way, characters in modern escapist films often lack what no computer effects can provide: a fully formed personality. “Encanto,” its excellent script credited to Castro Smith and Bush, surreptitiously undermines that cliche. With the Madrigals’ physical powers under threat, they must work on their inner selves. Perhaps Mirabel, one of Disney’s most engaging creations, has the greatest superpower of them all.",MLD_Doc8_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Positive,Encanto
78,MLD_Doc9_Encanto,"Foundations are important for both family and feature films. The Family Madrigal lives in an “encanto,” an enchanted place, as Mirabel (Stephanie Beatriz) explains in her opening song — introducing the cast, the child chorus, and more details than a six-week history course crammed into six minutes. Happily, all of the Madrigal kids and grandchildren have a magical ability… well, except Mirabel. She’d be okay with this — even their sentient house “Casita” doesn’t mind — if it weren’t for the constant reminders she was inexplicably passed over. When her cousin Antonio (Ravi Cabot-Conyers) becomes the first to receive a gift after her failure, Mirabel notices the candle empowering the encanto is beginning to falter during the ensuing celebration. Their abuela (grandmother) Alma (María Cecilia Botero) assures both family and friends there is no such issue, the declaration quietly suggesting Mirabel’s dire warning is born of jealousy — the beginning of cracks showing in not only the Casita but in the Family Madrigal itself. Similar to other Disney fare where filmmakers explore and embrace a region for a feature presentation, Encanto is constructed around Colombian customs and ideals. Including eight original bilingual songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a score composed by Germaine Franco, the story is born of tragedy, sorrow, and triumph in how the Madrigal family came to be. While these are the seeds of the back story, it in no way informs upon what the movie is actually about… or the odd direction it takes. As told by a character who would be relegated to the background in any other version of a film such as this, is the music, colorful culture, and mysteries within enough to lure audiences into theaters? The time period is non-specific, but there are suggestions it stems from the Thousand Days’ War, a conflict begun in 1899 and the cause of many Colombians fleeing their homes to survive a political genocide (sorry, kids; it happens). The repeatedly referenced “faceless riders” remembered in Alma’s grief are given no additional explanation or consideration; this works against the narrative because the film doesn’t really have a traditional villain… even after countless cues and suggestions there absolutely should be. With a vibrant score suggesting hidden dangers which never materialize, the final cut feels undercut. It’s as if a more exciting story was muted to make room for too much of the family ensemble until it’s all that remained, leaving Mirabel appearing to apologize in advance on every advertising poster: “I thought there’d be a better story here, too — who knew?” Lin-Manuel Miranda has become a go-to songwriter for Disney — look at Mary Poppins Returns, for example — with an eclectic style that embraces many song genres, perfect for any Disney musical or the Broadway stage. For Encanto, however, it feels as if the story was either made to fit the songs afterward or the story was changed after the songs were made. This kind of thing happens in development all the time; for example, The Emperor’s New Groove had a villain’s song for Ysma sung by Eartha Kitt; while the song was great, changes to the script scrapped the need for it. Encanto is at the top of its game with the rapid-fire song sequences, but the in-betweens feel forced or dull in comparison, certainly not what was promised and falling flat rather than being triumphant. The repeated hints at a darker or more dangerous story comes off as pure bait-and-switch, unfulfilling at best and boring at worst… but hey, nice songs, though. There’s a good message here, but it’s muddled with suggestions something more going on that isn’t. The truth is worse than a Disney villain: it’s gaslighting by and from people who were assumed trustworthy or having one’s back. Villains lie to heroes and heroines all the time — it’s what they do, after all — but how does one forgive a knowingly false accusation and turning everyone against them with all the hurt that would cause? If the filmmakers had embraced this as the actual theme from the beginning, it’d have made more sense (and been a completely different movie), but did the filmmakers even realize what they’d done in the end? It makes one wonder if an alternate ending — with Mirabel washing her hands of the Family Madrigal and hiking off to Brazil — might be an extra for the home release. Encanto is rated PG for some thematic elements, mild peril, and using the name “Mirabel” in a song more times than “Roxanne.”",MLD_Doc9_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Negative,Encanto
79,MLD_Doc10_Encanto,"It’s colourful, boisterous, brimming with song and magic, yet Disney’s ‘Encanto’ is far-from-enchanting, a little forced and, well, rather dull. It’s beautiful to look at, the animation is first-class, it’s full of lovely songs and quirky characters and magic, with positive messaging about community togetherness and family values and being yourself but, to be perfectly honest, the latest offering from Disney is, well, a bit of a bore. One of the issues that has emerged with a lot of animated features of late is how they are all heightened in some way, with the story core typically involving something outlandish, weird or magical. Encanto turns out to be so heightened, so crammed full of magic that it lacks any real punch or sense of consequence. There’s so much magic in the film you kind of get a bit magicked out. Young Mirabel Madrigal (Stephanie Beatriz) lives in a magical house with a magical family where each person has a magic gift that they use to make life positively magical for the community that has grown up around them. The magical state of affairs came about because of a magic candle that was used to protect the family when they were running from some ill-defined horseback-riding foe and lost a family member. But while all her siblings and relative have special gifts of some sort, Mirabel doesn’t, making her different, though she is still much loved. Less loved is Uncle Bruno (John Leguizamo), whose powers of foresight have estranged him from the family, though it’s never clearly explained why somebody with such an immeasurably valuable gift would be alienated. Surely you’d want to keep somebody who could see into the future close by, especially when it comes to filling out a lotto ticket or betting on a horse. But can all this magic be too much of a good thing? Cue the movie’s message as Mirabel begins having disturbing visions of cracks appearing throughout the house, even though the palatial abode has the magical power to repair itself. The strength of the magic that imbues the family seems to be waning. Oh no! What can be done? Can Mirabel do something about it? Something magical, even though she’s not magical? Or is she? Is there not magic within us all? And so forth. Encanto has got to have one of the most abstracted narratives of any Disney animated feature, making it occasionally hard to follow and certainly difficult to relate to. Even some of the conceptually wackier films, such as Monsters, Inc, kept a foot on the ground. There’s not much of a quest or sense of adventure involved in the story either, making it feel somewhat inert. Thematically, the film beats the same drum as most kids films do. Everybody has their own magic, the film champions, and you know the magic Encanto is talking about. It’s the magic that comes from – get ready for it – being yourself. Just once it’d be great to see an animated family film that doesn’t feature this theme somewhere. Of course it’s important to be yourself yet, surely, there are times when being yourself can get you, and others, into lots of trouble. And for all the splendour, colour and movement of the many songs in Encanto – written by Hamilton’s Lin-Manuel Miranda, no less – they go on too long and don’t really develop story or character, instead repeating in song what has already been established. Storywise, it’s just a lot of running on the spot. You can literally pop out for popcorn or visit the lav and not worry about missing anything important. (In stark contrast, the songs in the upcoming musical-drama Dear Evan Hansenare deeply woven into the story.) The magical setting of Encanto is Columbia, so the film is respectfully adorned with all the appropriate Latino costumes, architecture, décor and designs you’d expect, and it looks lovely. But it’s just icing. What’s missing is any real sense of threat – aside from the possibility the magical house they live in might stop being so magical. The strained charm of Encanto has that anodyne feel of a film too afraid to offend anybody. Nobody in the film is bad, just misunderstood. Sorry, but that’s boring. Perhaps this is why the film has no real villain. Again, Dullsville. Apologies for the laboured metaphor, but just as an oyster needs a grain of grit to make a pearl, so, too, a story needs a touch of the nasty to create tension and emotional engagement with its audience. This actually puts Encanto at odds with most classic Disney animated features. Maybe the creators were eager to avoid that convention and do something different. Unfortunately, it makes for a film that, for all its beautifully rendered bells and whistles, just isn’t all that interesting.",MLD_Doc10_Encanto,MLD,Comedy,Negative,Encanto

We get to see Harry deliver some hilarious put-downs to a group of thugs (or ""punks"" as he hisses at them) who are taunting him in an elevator after being acquitted in court. There is finally a line of dialogue to match the ""Do I feel lucky?"" line from the first movie. It's the classic: ""Go ahead...make my day."" And Harry gets a cool, new Magnum pistol, a weapon even more powerful that his Magnum .44 (why he'd want a weapon more powerful than that is anyone's guess. Maybe it's because he's after a group of baddies this time instead of one like Scorpio or maybe Clint was getting a lot of money from the Magnum gun company for product placement.) He keeps it in a special presentation box, but, when the villains sink to new lows, Harry's eye begins twitching in the direction of his new gun and...well, you can guess what happens next!

Once Harry is sent on vacation and gets mixed up in a rape revenge plot involving Sondra Locke, the film nosedives and never recovers (although Harry does acquire a charming, farting bulldog called Meathead).

The gang-rape scenes are repeated over and over in flashbacks and they seem to go on forever and Eastwood really goes too far as a director with it all. He has directed much better movies than this one and I don't think ""Sudden Impact"" would be in his top ten somehow.

The baddies in this film are just a bunch of leering, wild-eyed psychos with none of the complexity of the Scorpio killer from the first film. Perhaps this is to make the audience not care about them as they are castrated by bullet and then murdered. (There is a particularly grotesque foul-mouthed, butch lesbian character among the group of rapists who is like something out of a John Waters movie. It's a relief when her character isn't around).

Harry has clearly changed his mind about vigilante justice from the days of ""Magnum Force"" ten years earlier. In that film, he refused to join a cabal of vigilante cops with the line: ""I'm afraid you've misjudged me."" In this film, Harry Callahan is essentially an accomplice to a vigilante killer and an accessory to murder. The film has the dodgy moral message that it's okay to be a vigilante if the crime you're avenging is bad enough. Harry is reduced to being a clone of the Charles Bronson character from the ""Death Wish"" movies, mowing down villains by the truckload. The script never questions the actions of the Sondra Locke character who is presented as a sort of feminist martyr.

The rape revenge story was not a Dirty Harry script when it started out and Eastwood tried to fashion it into one and it doesn't work (perhaps Clint just wanted to make a Dirty Harry movie with Sondra Locke, God knows she was in every other film he'd made for almost ten years by that stage). The ""Sudden Impact"" script does not have the razor-sharp focus that the first film had from start to finish and it's frustrating that they came so close to matching it and gave up.

The film gets increasingly ridiculous and nasty as it goes on until it just peters out. You are kind of glad when its over as its a little embarrassing for all concerned. No wonder Clint doesn't want to make anymore Dirty Harry films, he's gone as far as he can with the character of Harry Callahan.",DBG_Doc1_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact
81,DBG_Doc2_SuddenImpact,"I first saw ""Sudden Impact"" in the theatre when it first came out at Christmas 1983. I also saw the first three of the series ""Dirty Harry"", ""Magnum Force"" and ""The Enforcer"" in the theatre and have all three in my DVD collection. I don't have ""Sudden Impact"" and don't want it. I was very disappointed in it.

This is the only one of the series that Clint Eastwood directed himself. But he has proven to be a fine director since, having won the ""Oscar"" for Best Director twice...for the western ""Unforgiven"" in 1993 and the drama ""Million Dollar Baby"" in 2005. He has directed many good movies, but ""Sudden Impact"" isn't one of them.

It stars his then girlfriend, Sondra Locke, as a woman bent on revenge upon the creeps who gang raped her and her sister....leaving her sister catatonic in a mental institution. She's executing each one-by-one. Inspector Harry Callahan is on the case to track her down. Harry also has a new weapon to go along with his Smith and Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum: a .44 Auto Mag. As critic Roger Ebert put it: ""That's just what Harry needs is another gun."" The movie wasn't as exiting and suspenseful as the other three because it was so slow moving and predictable and at times ridiculous. Bruce Surtees,( who worked on Producer and Director Don Siegel's ""Dirty Harry""),cinematography here is always too dark and depressing looking.Composer Lalo Schifrin's score is pretty good but he's done better.The late Albert Popwell who played the bank robber in the famous scene in ""Dirty Harry"";where Harry asks him if he feels lucky and he replies "" I gots to know! "";the pimp in the pink Cadillac in ""Magnum Force"" and the black militant leader in ""The Enforcer"" is promoted to playing Harry's partner here.

Clint Eastwood said that, in retrospect, he did two too many of the Dirty Harry pictures. It was originally meant to be a trilogy like ""The Man With No Name"" trilogy (""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good,The Bad and The Ugly"".) He should have ended the Dirty Harry series with ""The Enforcer"" back in 1976 and quit while he was ahead.The film critic Gene Siskel who called ""Dirty Harry"" an American classic gave ""Sudden Impact"" a thumbs down.But he did say Clint Eastwood gave a good performance,The film historian Leonard Maltin who has been putting out a movie review guide book for more than 40 years now gave ""Dirty Harry"" three and a half stars out of four, didn't like this one either.

Some trivia for you: Sondra Locke and Clint Eastwood were together for more than ten years, having done six pictures together (""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" in 1976, ""The Gauntlet"" in 1977, ""Every Which Way But Loose"" in 1978, and ""Bronco Billy"" and ""Any Which Way You Can"" in 1980. They broke up in 1990,she sued hum for fraud in 1994 saying he was trying to ruin her career. Sondra Locke later wrote a book on their life together even though he asked her not to in the late 1990's called ""The Good,The Bad and The Very Ugly"". I haven't read it and,don't plan to.

Clint Eastwood said in interview back in 1988 that if another person comes up to him and says ""Go Ahead.Make My Day"" again that he will go hang himself. So,I guess if you ever happen to meet Mr. Eastwood don't say that line. He would appreciate it.",DBG_Doc2_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact
82,DBG_Doc3_SuddenImpact,"At bottom, Clint Eastwood's ""Sudden Impact,"" now at area theaters, seems incorrigibly stale as well as unsavory. Even if you derive a slightly shameful pleasure from the indomitable, reactionary fantasy figure of Dirty Harry Callahan, Eastwood's most popular creation, it's difficult to view ""Sudden Impact"" as anything more exciting or authentic than the action movie equivalent of drawn-out foreplay and faked orgasm.
I don't doubt for a second that the movie will entertain and reassure all the importuning showmen and devoted fans who evidently convinced Eastwood that it would be prudent to resurrect Harry, still the scourge of officialdom in a crime-ridden San Francisco. He had put the role on ice seven years ago, following a third installment called ""The Enforcer,"" and judging from his statements in Norman Mailer's deftly equivocal appreciation in a recent issue of Parade, Eastwood felt no artistic itch for Harry. ""I wasn't intending to do any more of these characters,"" Mailer quotes him as saying. ""I never particularly wanted to. I thought I'd done all I can with it, and I might have. I don't know. But everybody kept asking about it.""
As a matter of fact, the modest showing of the atrocious ""Firefox"" two summers ago and the utter failure of the gamely offbeat but depressing ""Honkytonk Man"" last Christmas probably combined to soften Eastwood up for a new round of Dirty Harry. There's no indication that he missed the role, and he enjoyed substantial success with new wrinkles off his basic heroic stolidity during the interval--as another cop in the slam-bang, hilariously profane chase thriller ""The Gauntlet,"" as straight man for Clyde the orangutan in ""Every Which Way but Loose"" and ""Any Which Way You Can"" and as a tough con in ""Escape From Alcatraz."" Moreover, he hasn't returned to it with the sort of robust and infectiously humorous glow that Sean Connery brought to James Bond in ""Never Say Never Again."" There's a weary, frazzled, imposed-upon undercurrent to the Harry who reappears in ""Sudden Impact."" For all practical commercial purposes, Eastwood can go through these self-imitative motions skillfully enough, but I can't believe he's still got his heart in the charade.
The script makes only a token effort to sustain suspense for feature length. ""Sudden Impact"" is contrived to match Harry, endangered by murderous scum on one side and nagging bureaucrats on the other, with an alarmingly compatible female scourge--Sondra Locke as a somnambulistic avenger named Jennifer Spencer who is determined to kill the party of degenerates who molested her and her kid sister a decade earlier. In pursuit of this lethal vindication, the obviously cuckoo and far from enticing Jennifer leaves a distinctive .38-caliber calling card, drilling victims through the crotch as well as the forehead. Even making generous allowances for the trumped-up trauma that motivates her, this antiheroine is rather tough to warm to. Nevertheless, events are manipulated to unite her and Harry in both common cause and romantic consolation.
Since there's no mystery surrounding the identity of the killer, the content is largely an exercise in spectacular busywork and delaying actions, which take the form of repeated chases, stalkings and gunfights. The first half-hour or so has an irresistibly funny class-reunion quality, as Harry and his antagonists touch all the old bases. For example, Harry can barely conceal a sneer of contempt as he's read the riot act by a criminal-coddling judge (Lois de Banzie),) and when one of the coddled creeps tries to wise off to him in a courthouse elevator, Harry gets to put him straight with outrageously profane emphasis.
Still, the body count reaches a downright enervating level--according to an acquaintance who bothered to count, 19 corpses pile up over the course of the show--and Eastwood isn't particularly adept at blending facetiousness and viciousness. For example, Audrie J. Neenan is an intermittent panic as a degenerate broad, but the mind boggles trying to make sense of the character as conceived--the bisexual moll of a smalltown psycho, she evidently lured the heroine and her sister into a gang rape and then merrily participated in the molestation. Like the bullets beneath the belt, this is perhaps a touch on the excessively sadistic side.
Happily, Eastwood himself seems to have a very modest conception of the popular gratification supplied by the Dirty Harry movies. ""I feel they're fantasy,"" he told Mailer. ""I don't think my movies are that stimulating. People in the audience just sit there and say, 'I admire the independence, I'd like to have the nerve to tell the boss off or have that control . . .' "" Sounds plausible, and Eastwood's directing style tends to go curiously dreamlike and even hallucinatory during action sequences, sleepwalking through fantasies of violent confrontation and retribution as dispassionately as Sondra Locke's character. Perhaps this form of communal fantasy is rendered fundamentally harmless by the dream-maker's oddly detached outlook (reflected pictorially in his fondness for spacious, gliding overhead perspectives) and crackpot obviousness.
Dirty Harry's appeal is probably too transparent to be insidious. ",DBG_Doc3_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact
83,DBG_Doc4_SuddenImpact,"""Sudden Impact,"" like all of the Dirty Harry movies starring Clint Eastwood, has some subtle messages about a lackluster American justice system with only a handful of people, some with a badge and some not, willing to stick their necks out in order to see the right thing done. That has always been the communiqué ducking beneath the insistent gunfire, slashing, and explosions that make up the bulk of these pictures. My problem with ""Sudden Impact,"" apart from having been mostly bored by the film, was that it left me with these two very different realizations: in a Dirty Harry film, the hero should remain in San Francisco; Mr. Eastwood should remain in front of the camera.

This film, the only one which Mr. Eastwood directed as well as starred in, is by far the weakest. It is truly surprising, since it does start out very well. Of course, that's when the movie is still set in San Francisco. It is here that we get the Dirty Harry material that we look for. Early on, a punk arrested by Mr. Eastwood is let off scot-free by the courts. He gives the inspector a snide remark, Dirty Harry grabs him by the collar, berates him, and slams him against the elevator wall. Classic. More so is the famous diner sequence and the movie's signature line.

But shortly after this point, Dirty Harry takes a trip to San Paulo, tracking yet another serial killer—one whose M.O. is shooting her victim once in the head and once in the genitals—and the movie goes completely downhill. It is no longer exciting or very funny. Instead, ""Sudden Impact"" becomes pretentious, depressing, and extremely ponderous. It's a movie in no hurry to see itself end; I only wish I could have felt the same.

A core problem is the lack of a commanding villainess. As in the original ""Dirty Harry"" from 1971, we see the murderer in a close-up at the very beginning, so there is no mystery for the audience to piece together. The difference is this: the psychotic sharpshooter from the original ""Dirty Harry"" was a disgusting and utterly repulsive creep. As played by Sondra Locke in this film, the rape victim taking her revenge on the men who molested her and her now-vegetative sister, is uninteresting. And what the screenplay has to offer Miss Locke is not a whole heck of a lot better. It utilizes the tiresome gimmick of flashbacks intercut with the killer executing her victims. The shooting parts are effectively handled, but the clumsy flashbacks trivialize them. Furthermore, the movie does not set itself a mind in how to portray Miss Locke: empathetic victim or scumbag. I think the movie was leaning more toward the former, but I kept on feeling disgust for her. Almost as much as I had for the snarling little twerps she was preying upon.

To make matters worse, Miss Locke is really the center focus of the story. She's almost the real star of the movie. Mr. Eastwood's Dirty Harry really plays second-fiddle. The movie chugs along with some lousy moments where they confront each other, including an all-time low for the series where they share a bed for the night. At that point in the film, I threw my hands in the air, ready to give up.

As the man standing behind the camera, Clint Eastwood disappoints this time around. He has demonstrated before and since ""Sudden Impact"" that he is a very capable director. The problem here is that he seems to have favored tossing out his own flair in exchange for imitating the men who directed him before. With the exception of the San Francisco scenes—yes, they are really the best part of the movie. I cannot emphasize that enough—we do not see his director's personae in the images. It does not feel like a Clint Eastwood film; it feels like a second-rate imitation of a Don Siegel film or a Ted Post film. I wish Mr. Eastwood had either trusted his instincts or allowed another director to handle the material. Maybe he did learn the lesson, as Buddy Van Horn directed the fifth (and better) entry in the series, ""The Dead Pool.""

Just as surprising as the overall boredom of the film was the insulting sting of its ending: an ending that I cannot imagine the Dirty Harry Callahan of the previous three movies in the franchise would have allowed to be. Here the movie's subtle message about justice and doing the right thing contradicts itself, and it left me feeling disturbed and unclean. ""Sudden Impact"" is about as joylessly depressing and clumsy as its nighttime cinematography. Dirty Harry has surrounded himself with nobody interesting. His semi-partner in the film, Albert Popwell (finally given a good-guy role in the franchise) is underwritten, and Mr. Eastwood's most frequent companion is a flatulent bulldog. The humor is not very humorous. The action is not very exciting. The film is surprisingly dull.",DBG_Doc4_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact
84,DBG_Doc5_SuddenImpact,"You know those Simpsons episodes where they do the running gag ""McGarnagle""? The one which is a thin parody of Harry Callahan? I'm now less convinced that McGarnagle is a parody, and more convinced that it was a discarded script of this movie which the Simpsons creators used.

Sudden Impact is so stupid that its funny. Most bad action films are just boring - A Walk Among the Tombstones comes to mind. But Sudden Impact is just so cartoonish and stupid that I burst out laughing every few minutes. This film has every single cliché that I didn't think was actually a thing that ever exists. The small town cop who shouts at Callahan ""we don't need big city folks telling us how to do our jobs"". The threats to ""back off or I'll have you locked up!"". Mandatory vacations for cops who are too badass. The constant references to vague authority figures who are ""climbing up my ass"" says a generic slightly lower authority figure. This film's screenplay is actually hilarious. Harry goes to the beach to a crime scene, where a big deal is made of the fact that the inspector goes there himself. The inspector demands to know what happened at Harry's hotel room (Harry gunned down a would-be assassin), like Harry broke a lamp or something. It'd be funny if they hadn't just made a big deal of the fact that this is a dead body.

Sudden Impact has no story arc for Harry - its just a series of scenes where nameless henchmen try to kill him and he survives with increasingly comedic implausibility. Seriously - there are like 5 attempts on his life in 30 minutes. Each time, he dispatches them and carries on his business - walking his dog (which has several sex changes throughout the movie), irritating his boss, practising his shooting, etc. Cut into these inane sequences is the story of Jennifer Spencer (an extremely dull Sondra Locke) who is seeking out and murdering all of her rapists. At one point, Eastwood (who is behind the camera as director, would you believe it) accidentally inspires the Kill Bill revenge flashes with a scene that only highlights how much better Tarantino did it 20 years later. Spencer is such a boring character - her chemistry with Eastwood is non-existent and the final struggle with Head Rapist is just motions while we wait for Harry to show up.

Eastwood is one of my favourite directors but there are some dreadful shots that should never have gotten through here. An old lady yanks a sniper rifle out from the counter to threaten Harry, who is assaulting witnesses to gain testimony (seriously?) Several various people are shot in the head and noticeably still breathing as their actors incompetently go through their death scenes. And in the film's most ludicrous scene, Harry drives a burning car along the pier, looking at the flames as if they are a minor irritation, before parking, exiting, reaching back into the flames and throwing a molotov at the attackers, who are all killed.

This movie would have been more plausible if Harry was revealed to be a T-1000. Its so stupid its hilarious. I give it three stars - two stars just for the awesome line ""go ahead, make my day"".",DBG_Doc5_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Negative,Sudden_Impact
85,DBG_Doc6_SuddenImpact,"Most of what you hear about pop art and pop culture is pure hype. But there comes a moment about halfway through ""Sudden Impact,"" the new Dirty Harry movie, when you realize that Harry has achieved some kind of legitimate pop status, as the purest distillation in the movies of the spirit of vengeance. To all those cowboy movies we saw in our youth, all those TV Westerns and cop dramas and war movies, Dirty Harry has brought a great simplification: A big man, a big gun, a bad guy and instant justice.
We learned early to cheer when John Wayne shot the bad guys. We cheered when the Cavalry turned up, or the Yanks, or the SWAT Team. What Eastwood's Dirty Harry movies do is very simple. They reduce the screen time between those cheers to the absolute minimum.
""Sudden Impact"" is a Dirty Harry movie with only the good parts left in. All the slow stuff, such as character, motivation, atmosphere and plot, has been pared to exactly the minimum necessary to hold together the violence. This movie has been edited with the economy of a 30-second commercial. As a result, it's a great audience picture. It's not plausible, it doesn't make much sense, it has a cardboard villain and, for that matter, a hero who exists more as a set of functions (grin, fight, chase, kill) than as a human being. But none of those are valid objections.
""Sudden Impact"" is more like a music video; it consists only of setups and payoffs, its big scenes are self-contained, it's filled with kinetic energy, and it has a short attention span. That last is very important, because if anyone were really keeping track of what Callahan does in this movie, Harry would be removed from the streets after his third or fourth killing. Dirty Harry movies are like Roadrunner cartoons; the moment a body is dead, it is forgotten, and nobody stands around to dispose of the corpses.
The movie's basically a revenge tragedy. A young woman (Sondra Locke) and her sister are sexually attacked at a carnival by a group of quasi-human bullies. The sister goes nuts, and Locke vows vengeance. One by one, she tracks down the rapists, and murders them by shooting them in the genitals and forehead. Dirty Harry gets assigned to the case, and the rest is a series of violent confrontations.
Occasionally there's comic relief, in the form of Harry's meetings with his superiors, and his grim jawed put-downs of anyone who crosses his path. (""Suck fish heads,"" he helpfully advises one man.) If the movie has a weakness, it's the plot. Because I'm not sure the plot is relevant to the success of the film, I'm not sure that's a weakness.
The whole business of Locke's revenge is so mechanically established and carried out that it's automatic, and because she has a ""good"" motive for her murders, she doesn't make an interesting villain. If Eastwood could create a villain as single-minded, violent, economically chiseled and unremittingly efficient as Dirty Harry Callahan, then we'd be onto something.",DBG_Doc6_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact
86,DBG_Doc7_SuddenImpact,"For the second film in my series about nineteen-eighties action movies that I’d missed the first time around, I picked Clint Eastwood’s “Sudden Impact,” from 1983, the fourth of the five Dirty Harry films, the one that launched the iconic line “Make my day,” and the only one of the five that Eastwood himself directed. In choosing this film, I had a slight ulterior motive: because I think highly of many of Eastwood’s films, I wanted to find out if it stood up alongside the best of his work, and, if so, what distinguishes it from last week’s film, “Die Hard,” not merely in subject but in artistry. And I think that the film offers an answer or two—but they’re not at all of the sort that I’d anticipated.
Watching “Die Hard,” I was struck by the drama’s contempt for conventional authority, for administration, bureaucracy, and, for that matter, for government at large. But nothing in its satire of police-procedure-as-usual matches Eastwood’s rage at the system, his view of a judicial order that exists to defend violent criminals from the law rather than to bring them to justice. The movie begins with a courtroom scene in which a judge (Lois De Banzie) reproaches the uninhibited San Francisco police inspector Harry Callahan (Eastwood) for conducting an illegal search on an accused criminal (or, rather, on someone whom Callahan knows to be a criminal). She throws out the evidence, reproaches Harry for his record of taking the law into his own hands, and sends the defendant back to the streets—and, first, to the elevator, where he and his cronies taunt Harry, who grabs him by the throat and promises to catch him and deal with him as he deserves.
That’s just the prelude to the incident that sparks the main plot. In a secluded spot beside the bay, a man and a woman grapple romantically in the front seat of a car—until the woman takes out a gun, shoots the man in the genitals and in the head, and flees. Flashbacks reveal that the woman, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke), and her sister Elizabeth (Lisa Britt), had, a decade earlier, been gang-raped in another secluded spot, near a small-town carnival. Elizabeth was left catatonic and is living in a mental institution; Jennifer has become a successful artist. None of the rapists was ever caught or punished, even though Jennifer knows exactly who they are. (For that matter, the drama ultimately reveals the complicity of local law enforcement in protecting the culprits.) That’s why she’s putting into action a plot for revenge, systematically tracking down the men who raped her and her sister (and the one woman who helped plan the attack). And when Harry is sent to investigate the killing of the first rapist, additional victims, killed in the same way, start turning up; thus, Harry will ultimately find himself in the position of turning up evidence against, and having to arrest, Jennifer.
Speaking to a fellow-officer, Harry vociferously decries the state of society in a rant that sounds like the cinema according to Archie Bunker: “The shootings, the knifings, the beatings. Old ladies being bashed in the head for their Social Security checks. Teachers thrown from fourth-floor windows because they don't give A’s.” He complains that their job involves “having to wade through the scum of this city. Being swept away by bigger and bigger waves of corruption, apathy, and red tape. . . . Having our fingers in the holes while the entire dike crumbles around us.” But Harry has a problem, which the movie presents as society’s problem: he himself seems to be something of a magnet for it. As his captain tells him, “You are a walking frigging combat zone. People have a nasty habit of getting dead around you.”
That’s where “Make my day” comes in. Harry drops into a diner for a cup of coffee and discovers that there’s a robbery in progress: four black men, pretending to be ordinary customers, pull guns on the patrons and demand their valuables. Harry comes in the back way and calls the gunmen “you boys” while ordering them to put their weapons down. I was ready to vomit when I heard the slur, and was just as disgusted by Eastwood’s depiction of an integrated clientele as a Trojan horse for black predators. (The fact that Harry’s best friend and fellow-officer, Horace, played by Albert Popwell, is black does little to mitigate the stereotype that the diner scene embodies and perpetuates.) When three of the robbers turn their guns at him, Harry shoots them down with a line of sick, cheesy bravado; when the fourth grabs a woman and puts a gun to her head to hold her hostage, that’s when Harry tells him, “Go ahead—make my day.” What surprised me about the moment is the utter lack of conviction with which Harry utters it. The line falls with far more—or, rather, far less—than the usual laconic Eastwood plainspokenness. Rather, it drops, spoken as if under a sort of constraint—an odd thing for a director-star with his own production company to evoke. To put it plainly, Eastwood seems embarrassed.
The course of the action as it continues from that scene suggests the contradictions and self-contradictions that make the film an absorbing experience—that make “Sudden Impact” far better than the repellent premises on which it’s based. In watching the movie and being drawn into Eastwood’s view of a society rendered dysfunctional by its misplaced sympathies, I found myself seeing something else at the same time: a view of a society and the very idea of what society means. Even though Eastwood sketches an us-against-them struggle between those who defend that idea of society and those who turn that idea against itself, he also draws together, with a brisk and light touch, tight bonds of interconnection, of community, that define a place and a time.
Eastwood takes painfully seriously the theme of rape ignored by the law and unpunished. Later in the movie, when Harry travels to the small town of San Paulo, where the rapes of Jennifer and her sister occurred, his disgust for the muck of its daily deceptions and benighted clannishness is reflected in his view of its casual smirking rapists circulating in plain sight and continuously protected by what passes in that town for grandees. Eastwood has no sympathy for the male code of silence any more than for the street harassment that male louts are seen subjecting women to; the rapists may have been young when they committed their crime, but Eastwood has no truck with the idea of mere youthful indiscretions. His sense of the social bonds that hold a community together overlap with his vision of the code of silence that protects monsters from facing the consequences of their crimes.
Eastwood’s vision of social bonds is essentially tragic, and he infuses the movie with a harrowing, hectically subjective tone to match. The movie’s frenzies of jagged light and of murky darkness, the streams of blood and the tight closeups—as well as Jennifer’s own harrowing, fragmented recollections of the attack—suggest a world out of whack. Eastwood may not be the most overtly cinephilic, homage-bound director, but “Sudden Impact” resounds with some conspicuously Hitchcockian elements (specifically, hints of “Vertigo,” “Marnie,” “The Birds,” and “Strangers on a Train”). I think that the allusions are no accidents—that there’s an essential element of Hitchcockian guilt woven into the fabric of “Sudden Impact.” In Eastwood’s film, all sympathies are potentially misguided; all actions, even ones done in pursuit of his own clear sense of justice, risk devastating results. (For instance, Harry ultimately, if indirectly, gets his best friend killed.) The ending of the film—featuring a return of the “make my day” line—offers mighty ambiguities in the guise of Harry’s decisive heroism. It’s a virtually deus-ex-machina-like ending, when men are again holding a woman, this time Jennifer, hostage—and this time, Harry shows up after having virtually come back from the dead and morphed into a living myth, in a return that’s more symbolic than it is dramatic. This time he says the line with force and conviction.
President Ronald Reagan, in March, 1985—a little more than a year after the release of “Sudden Impact”—used the line “Go ahead—make my day” in a political speech about taxes. I have a little theory: I’ll bet that Eastwood didn’t like it. He may have admired Reagan, but he saw his own bravado of violence tossed about as more than a meme—as a signifier of op-ed crosstalk, of office politics as usual. He saw himself turning into a mascot for the suits—and for Eastwood, this was a particular problem, because his very subject, from the start of his career, with “Play Misty for Me,” was the danger of demagogy, the abuse of a public image. The quasi-angelic, nearly supernatural apparition of Harry at the end of “Sudden Impact” suggests that he had already envisioned himself as his own next hero, the one of “Pale Rider,” a ghost of himself. He’d continue with the irony of “Heartbreak Ridge,” the tragedy of “Bird,” the self-scourging of “White Hunter Black Heart.” In “Sudden Impact,” Eastwood seems to have administered to himself a powerful, painful cure for self-righteous swagger. The impressive unity of “Die Hard” is a mark of professional craft; the frenzied disunity of “Sudden Impact” is a mark of art.",DBG_Doc7_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact

Harry Callahan goes for a coffee get's a lot of sugar and decides to complain finds a bunch of robbers and he goes in to action and shoots the guys. Great action piece of the 80's.

Great performance by Clint Eastwood lots of action I love the scene in which is Eastwood with a shadow and his .44 AutoMag in his hand. Good score by Lalo Schifrin I enjoy the new score. Dirty Harry has bulldog named Meathead I love his dog. I love dogs I am an animal lover.

Sudden Impact is my second favorite movie in the franchise. I would say is better than all 6 Death Wish movies at bunch. Insp. Harry Callahan is a bad ass in the movie great action movie one of Clint Eastwood's best movies I have ever seen. I love, love this movie to death the most successful Dirty Harry movie ever.",DBG_Doc8_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact
88,DBG_Doc9_SuddenImpact,"The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts. It is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan (as played by Clint Eastwood) so popular. He carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, Harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing. But it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen. And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `Sudden Impact,' directed by and starring Eastwood, so successful. In this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: Whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.

In his own inimitable way, Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time. So he does; as only `Dirty Harry' can. In a small town north of San Francisco, Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator. Unaccountably, Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief, Jannings (Pat Hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere. Not one to be deterred, however, Harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, Jennifer Spencer (Sondra Locke). Gradually, Harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture?

Eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `Dirty Harry.' It had been seven years since the last `Harry' offering (`The Enforcer,' 1976), but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor. And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4. As with all the films he directs, Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end.

The screenplay, by Joseph Stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `Dirty Harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith) is the most engaging since the original `Dirty Harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action. The characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of Harry's best catch-phrases: `Go, ahead-- make my day...'

As Harry, Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: He lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today. Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before. No matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry, or at least have him around. `Dirty Harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, Eastwood `is' Dirty Harry, without question, just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone, Sherlock Holmes.

Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.' She manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre. Even amid the violence, Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life. Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood's Harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.

In supporting roles, two performances stand out: Paul Drake, as Mick, creates the best `psycho' since Andy Robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `Dirty Harry.' With actually very limited screen time, Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience. This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end. Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan, who makes her character, Ray Parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city. It's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.

The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell (Horace), Mark Kevloun (Bennett) and Nancy Parsons (Mrs. Kruger). With a perfect blend of drama and action, `Sudden Impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience.",DBG_Doc9_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact
89,DBG_Doc10_SuddenImpact,"In the American popular imagination, few cops are more famous, some would say infamous, than Clint Eastwood's 'Dirty' Harry Callahan. His scowling visage, magnum revolver, and gritty one-liners are among the images most associated with the big city homicide detective. When kids play cops and robbers, he's the kind of cop they imagine themselves as. And why not? The film that introduced him remains one of the best, and certainly most iconic action thrillers of the twentieth century. And like any movie to enjoy such success, it spawned a good number of sequels. None were as good as the original, but some came fairly close, and none closer than Sudden Impact.

That's not to say that Sudden Impact sticks the closest to the original formula. This is a great deal darker and more brooding than the previous entries in the series, and more violent. Not in the sense that there are more violent acts than in the earlier films; but that the acts themselves are more brutal. Besides the myriad shootings there's a part where Callahan punches a woman in the face, leaving her with a black eye and a bloody nose. There's an extended scene in which Callahan is kicked, stomped, and bludgeoned within an inch of his life. And there are multiple POV flashbacks to a gang rape that occurred years before.

And the dividing line between good and bad, right and wrong, isn't nearly as clear cut this time around. Inspector Callahan has always been willing to go beyond the letter of the law to see the guilty punished, but giving an old man a heart attack at his granddaughters wedding is really something even by his standards, even if the guy was a mob boss and the main suspect in a brutal murder. It's a point where you have to stop and ask yourself, ""Has he gone too far this time?""

This same question is posed more strongly by the main storyline, which involves the victim of the aforementioned rape returning to gun down everyone involved. There's no question that what she's doing is cold blooded murder, or that it's Harry's job to stop her. But damned if she doesn't have a hell of a reason for wanting those people dead. And seeing how bitter and nasty some of them still are, it's hard not to sympathize with her. And it's inevitable that Harry will too.

Although many would disagree, I also felt that the aftermath of the violence isn't handled as cleanly and flippantly as before. True, no time is lost morning the dead, and the department lets Harry off much more easily than any real PD would. Yet so much of the violence and death here is a direct result of earlier violence. Of the many attempts on Harry's life, two are because of what he did to that old man, and a third is largely the result of him losing his temper earlier. And if it hadn't been for what happened one night under a boardwalk, seven people, one of them completely innocent, would still be alive.

Although the movie may not take the time to dwell on it, it seems that there's a cycle of violence underpinning the story. Every time someone kills or assaults someone, it begets further violence aimed at them, whether it's deserved or not. At the end there's finally an act of mercy and forgiveness, but even then I don't know if that was the right thing to do. I'm not sure that there was a right thing to do. And that's what I like about Sudden Impact. Though it may be composed of chases, shootouts, and one-liners, it's given me much to think about.",DBG_Doc10_SuddenImpact,DBG,Action,Positive,Sudden_Impact
90,CMJ_Doc1_SpeedRacer,"With the release of Speed Racer, it's becoming clear that the Wachowskis are not unlike David Mamet or Wes Anderson in that they have their own distinctive, consistent filmmaking style. It's their persistence in the belief that action and dialogue should seldom if ever take place at the same time — essentially, there is a time for talking and a time for fighting, and never the two shall meet. This began way back in 1999's The Matrix, where moments of great philosophical rhetoric receded only long enough for the characters to kick the crap out of each other. Almost 10 years later, they have at last perfected this speech-action-speech rhythm with Speed Racer — a film of such (literal) blinding ambition, artistic pretense and undeniable entertainment value that the Wachowskis may indeed have created the second truly iconic film of their young careers. Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) plays Speed, a kid who has dreamt of racing cars since he was in short pants. After his older brother Rex dies in a mysterious accident, Speed ascends the family throne and joyfully races for his father Pops (John Goodman). But when a ruthless tycoon named Royalton (Roger Allam) approaches him with a lucrative offer to buy the family business, Speed is forced to decide what matters more: the financial security of his family or the pure artistry of his racing out on the track. There's a ridiculous wealth of details left out of that synopsis, but that's the defining characteristic of a Wachowski film — twice as many words are necessary to convey the stakes of the story. Uniquely for a summer blockbuster, Speed Racer actually has too much plot for its own good, which will no doubt bore the film's preteen audience (or at least allow them to nap in between racing sequences). What matters here is that Speed is the best; he cares deeply about his family and refuses to sell out his principles no matter how insurmountable the odds stacked against him. (Seriously… in an adaptation of the animated series Speed Racer, who cares about corporate politics or anything else when there are so many colors, images, and — of course — races to marvel at?) Thankfully, the film more then delivers on the level of pure excitement, offering the most visually arresting world ever conceived for a piece of mainstream entertainment. Imagine Tokyo designed by Willy Wonka after watching Tron and you're somewhere in the ballpark. There's not a single thing in the film that looks remotely realistic, but the Wachowskis and director of photography David Tattersall (Star Wars Episodes I, II and III) commit with such passion to realizing this absurd, candy-coated universe that it somehow becomes believable. The actors, meanwhile, are shot unflinchingly with blaring lights and sharp-focus digital cameras that give them the exaggerated texture of colorized black and white film; if you ever wondered what each of Matthew Fox's eyelashes looked like in excruciating detail then this is most definitely the film for you. What the Wachowskis have mastered over the last decade is creating a true sense of believability, and that's because they know how to distinguish from anything as pedestrian as realism. This is an important distinction to note because in movies, realism means nothing since every world created in the camera is literally constructed or manipulated; but believability testifies to a filmmaker's ability to make the audience go along for the ride when they construct or manipulate that world. Not only with Tattersall behind the lens but Industrial Light & Magic assembling the ones and zeroes, Speed Racer takes the technology George Lucas experimented with in the prequel trilogy and tests the limits of what it was designed for — namely, immersing the characters (and by extension, the audience) in worlds that they could only previously imagine in their heads. On the other hand, if one were to suggest that ""cartoonish"" was the only adjective needed to describe successful performances in a film like Speed Racer, they would only be half right. As with the plot, broad strokes work best when the filmmakers are doing as much (or in this case, more) visually as they are conceptually, and the characterizations need to be archetypal — which almost without exception, they are. Hirsch continues to mature into a solid leading man as he trades back and forth between paydays like this and Into the Wild, providing this film's squeaky-clean heroism as effortlessly as the Penn film's earnest intensity. Goodman and Susan Sarandon, both actors accustom to contributing simpler and less sophisticated performances than we know they're capable of, offer subtlety and sophistication as Pops and Mom Racer, even while they're clearly having fun. Further, Christina Ricci, whose enormous eyes help her contribute possibly the most authentic live-action interpretation of an anime heroine in cinema history, plays Trixie with wit and spice, delivering one of her most charming performances since her teenage years. And Matthew Fox manages to add enough layers to Racer X's monotone mysteriousness to craft a formidable (and more importantly, interesting) counterpart/ mentor for Speed's budding adulthood. While the jury's still out on whether the Wachowskis storytelling style is tolerable in more than single-serving doses (the Matrix sequels diminished with each installment, and V for Vendetta was insufferable), Andy and Larry do put together one truly spectacular speech in the film — a heart-to-heart delivered by Goodman at a crucial moment in the film. If only the rest of the speeches could be this economical and poetic, the directors wouldn't be oddball blockbuster-crafting recluses; rather, they would be Oscar-winning oddball blockbuster-crafting recluses. But one supposes it's a sign of maturity that they did finally find a moment where their sense of flourish and style could be applied to more than the exchanging of blows, or in this case, the dynamic crashing of cars. Overall, this anime adaptation is not merely the best film that it could be, it's pretty much exactly what it should be: full of exciting, brilliantly-conceived races, primary-color characterizations and an irresistible sense of fun. Loud, fast and always in danger of veering out of control, Speed Racer is a masterpiece of its kind, and a definitive benchmark for film not only as a special effects extravaganza but as the moment when the Wachowskis went from wunderkind directors to true auteurs. In other words, as a summer distraction, a singular work of art or just as sensory overload, Speed Racer is a movie you absolutely must see.",CMJ_Doc1_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Positive,Speed_Racer
91,CMJ_Doc2_SpeedRacer,"While Speed Racer may not win first place for the weekend, there’s really no reason why it shouldn’t. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) has always wanted to be a race car driver, following in the tire tracks of his big brother Rex. After a family falling out and subsequent tragedy, Speed takes up where his brother left off. When an industry tycoon named Royalton (Roger Allam) is turned down by Speed to race for him professionally, Royalton goes after Speed and his family any way he can, including fixing races by targeting Speed on the track. The mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) offers a solution to ruin Royalton and revealing him for the villain he is, but it will take everything Speed Racer has plus the support of his family and friends to prove there’s still one race car driver who can never be bought. After reading some early reviews, I can only wonder: what movie were “they” watching? Keep in mind that the task the Wachowskis took on was to create a believable world where high-tech, rocket-assisted, fuel-celled race cars are equipped standard with on-board jump-jacks and enough ultra-light, polymer car body armor to take several hits throughout a race without slowing down. In addition, they also had to build a story to accommodate the Racer family history and other elements into the film, celebrating what made Speed Racer fun to watch without making fun of the source material. The result is a film fans should love and parents can enjoy taking their entire families to. From the very beginning of the film, viewers are treated to a rich, colorful, utopian world of the future where everything is clean and the skies are blue. Some of the interiors are reminiscent of Dick Tracy, using base colors with almost no texture to mirror the clean lines of a cartoon. At the same time, the cast is spot-on with their characters: Racer X is still the coolest, Spritle (Paulie Litt) and his pet monkey Chim-Chim stir up trouble but still manage to help out in critical situations, Mom and Pops Racer (Susan Sarandon and John Goodman) are very much the concerned parents, and Trixie (Christina Ricci) actually manages to get away with lines like “Hubba hubba” and “Cool beans” without sounding foolish or looking any less beautiful. From the villains behind the scenes to the dirty drivers themselves, everything that made the cartoon fun is here, even the Mammoth Car. The editing, however, is what amazingly holds the film together for over two hours, because, frankly, there’s almost too much story to fit in. Flashbacks are appropriate and revealed as they need to be, keeping the story going forward as it races towards a ending that, while predictable, is still no less satisfying. The entire production is self-contained and demands no sequel, so I have to ask: what more was anyone looking for, or is it that they just can’t imagine a story this fantastic can actually be told at all? At one point during the film, Speed reveals that his family treats racing like a religion. If that’s true, don’t accuse me of being a Speed Racer apologist; I’m a convert.",CMJ_Doc2_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Positive,Speed_Racer
92,CMJ_Doc3_SpeedRacer,"The Wachowskis achieve a divine vision of psychedelic visual ecstasy — you won’t believe the sheer amount of color on the screen at any given time — while digging deep into a campy comic/dramatic tone that speaks to audiences of all ages. Emile Hirsch leads a flawless cast as the title character that carries the death of his car-racing brother Rex Racer (Scott Porter) as a constant inspiration to win races for his family’s racing business. Anti-corporate themes abound as the sport’s predatory company Royalton Industries tries to bring Speed and his family to the dark side of greed. Far-out racing sequences, ninja attacks, and a budding romance between Speed and his girlfriend Trixie (perfectly played by Christina Ricci) attend the trippy visual fun. Like a revved-up turbo mix of Warren Beatty’s “Dick Tracy” with 1982’s “Tron,” “Speed Racer” is a blast from start to finish. Since ending their Matrix trilogy with a whimper rather than its anticipated bang, the Wachowski Brothers have successfully turned their attention to uniting cartoon logic with live-action appeal. The pay-off is fast and non-stop. Fans of Tatsuo Yoshida’s ‘60s era Japanese anime cartoon series (originally entitled “Mach GoGoGo”) get plenty of positive reinforcement with key story elements, like the functional “A” through “G” buttons on the steering wheel of Speed’s car (the “Mach 5”) and his little brother Spritle’s pet monkey Chim-Chim. The filmmakers are careful to emphasize Spritle (well played by cherubic Paulie Litt) for his amusing little kid qualities of loving candy and constantly trying to prove himself as worthy of adult respect. Spritle and Chim-Chim get plenty of welcomed screen-time, and their constant slapstick shenanigans anchor the movie’s wild racing sequences from a child’s knee-high perspective of seeking fun at every opportunity. The diabolical Royalton (played by Roger Allam) introduces himself to the Racer family as an effeminate pancake-loving family man who wants nothing more than to provide them with the riches they deserve. But when Royalton gets Speed alone in his office to sign a contract piled high across his desk, we learn the depth of his corporate villainy. Every raced is fixed in Royalton’s worldview. If there is a running theme smuggled into this summer’s family movies (“Iron Man” included), it’s that profit for profit’s sake is to be avoided like the plague. “Speed Racer” balances between dangerous car race rallies and the nefarious intrigue that surrounds them. A low-fi animated introduction sequence gets us inside the mind of young Speed daydreaming in class about racing with his brother. He doodles car crashes in the pages of his notebook. We are transported to the joys of childhood when all that mattered was how far your imagination could take you away from the mundane realities of homework, chores, and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches — Speed’s mom (Susan Sarandon) makes them by the tray-full. If Speed is a rebel with a one-track mind, it’s an ethic of independence that he consciously inhabits with his family’s united approval. The movie’s greatest achievement lies in its embrace of a modern family entertainment in a broad yet boiled-down spectrum of soup to nuts humor, action, and unbridled festivity. You can find touches of inspiration drawn from everything from the Three Stooges to Jerry Lewis comedies to the camp humor of Pee-wee Herman. The audience is encouraged to laugh at characters, with characters, and at themselves for being so easily led. As Susan Sontag wrote, “You can’t do camp on purpose.” Here, the Wachowskis achieve a universal postmodern style and sensibility that comes from a connection between individual ambition and familial trust combined with lots of color and speed. It’s the fastest movie ever made.",CMJ_Doc3_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Positive,Speed_Racer
93,CMJ_Doc4_SpeedRacer,"In a summer full of remakes, rehashes and sequels, it’s good to see something fresh. And let’s face it, Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk and even Doctor Jones are about original as William Shatner’s hair. Speed Racer is an original film. Yes, it’s an adaptation of a cartoon series, and no its story is not groundbreaking in any way, but – and it’s a big slap you in the face with a giant Crayola ‘but’ – it is a movie the likes of which you haven’t seen before and probably won’t see again (until they green-light the inevitable sequel of course). The term “rollercoaster ride” was all but invented to describe it. The film starts with a young Speed Racer at school failing at his school work, and also failing to notice a young Trixie giving him the eye and showing an obvious obsession with racing cars. We see a fantastic shot of Speed in his imaginary world of racing, presented with a mixture of computer graphics and traditional cell animation. It’s a quick shot but beautifully put together, and a sure sign that you’re gonna see some cool shit in the next two hours… Let’s get something straight: this is a family movie. It’s very cheesy, it’s very inoffensive ands it’s been coloured by a hyperactive, acid-taking cartoon-loving nut job. Every shot is brilliantly composed using over-saturated colours, fluffy blue and white skies, purple skyscrapers and pink helicopters to name but a few. It’s as original in visual style as Roger Rabbit was back in its day. It can be jarring at first. To see such an over the top visual style is almost too much to handle. But you can’t help but enjoy it, and when you realise you’re doing so, you forget about the abnormality of it. After discovering some of the biggest and most prestigious races ever have been fixed by Royalton Industries’ top man, played by the lavishly over the top Roger Allam (V for Vendetta), Speed has to save his family’s business and the sport he loves by beating Royalton at his own game: racing. It’s all about the racing… And race he does, taking part in an infamous and lethal cross country race that spans two colourful continents and more “car-fu” than any Matrix fan boy could dream up, whilst polishing his 6 inch Neo.
One of the Wachowski Brothers’ talents lies in their ability to realise jaw dropping effects, previously demonstrated in the Matrix movies. For Speed Racer they shot all the action against green screens then took high definition 360 degree captures of exotic locations and created wraparound virtual sets that they could manipulate to any degree they wanted, recreating the flamboyance of Speed Racer. The effects, as you would expect these days are brilliant but unlike other movies the angle isn’t to achieve a reality we are familiar with, but instead to create an emotional impact. And in this case the emotions are most definitely fun and excitement. Casting is spot on with Emille Hirsch taking the lead as Speed Racer, a rather large John Goodman as Pops Racer, Susan Sarandon as Mom and Matthew Fox as the mysterious Racer X, an ally in Speed’s battle against the badass Royalton Industries.For the male audience, if 400mph car chases aren’t enough than Christina Ricci will definitely get a few pulses overclocking as Trixie, Speed’s brightly dressed and leggy girlfriend. She proves once again that she is an incredibly versatile actress (this is the lady we saw in last year’s Black Snake Moan). It’s just a shame that she’s a bit under used… Chuck in Inspector Detector, Sparky, Spirtle and a monkey named Chim Cham and you have the recipe for a summer blockbuster kids will go apeshit over. Which they will. The narrative is fast paced, the script snappy and appropriately cheesy, the action is intense and the last ten minutes when Speed Racer discovers his true abilities (akin to that of Neo in The Matrix) are quite simply very, very cool indeed. The Wachowskis have created a live action cartoon, a beautifully shot visual feast using all the things that traditionally would make a film unbearable. Yet in the case of Speed Racer, it makes it undeniably fun and entertaining. See this at the cinema, take a kid with you, go on a Saturday when there’s a good crowd. Then spend the rest of the day playing car chases with said child whilst giving the appearance it’s for their sake, and not because you’ve you just regressed 20 years and now have the mental age of a sugar intoxicated 10-year old.

94,CMJ_Doc5_SpeedRacer,"The Wachowskis have amazed again and shown us a world we'll only ever see in their imagination. Speed Racer is yet another visual revolution, but this time it's for kids, too. It's everything you'd imagine a live-action adaptation of the classic cartoon series would be, stylized and glorified in ways only the Wachowskis could dream up. After seeing it twice I confidently say that Speed Racer is the most entertaining and mind-blowing kids movie this year. At just over two hours, Speed Racer is longer than most kids' movies, yet it's still an exciting thrill ride from start to finish. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the second son in a family born of racing. His father Pops Racer (John Goodman) and older brother Rex Racer (Scott Porter) have independently built their own race cars all their life. Speed has grown up with racing in his blood and now it's his time to take to the track. After showing the world he is destined to become the next big thing in racing, the industry sponsors target him as their next big acquisition. Speed knows better than to give up his family for a sponsorship deal and remains independent, discovering not only how the racing industry truly works but also the price of messing with the wrong people. The race tracks and visuals in Speed Racer are unlike anything you'll ever see. This is unquestionably a kid's film and is designed strictly as a live interpretation of the cartoon. It's fair to call the visuals ""The Matrix with cars,"" but the PG-rated script follows the feeling of the cartoon closer than I've ever seen any adaptation do before. It's got all your standard kid's entertainment with goofy lines, inexplicable happenings, and joke moments, most of which usually involve Speed's younger brother Spritle (Paulie Litt) and his monkey friend Chim Chim. What I've really come to love about Speed Racer is how it takes us both on thrilling rides and shows us a vibrant world of high-speed racing combined with a simple yet captivating story. The Wachowskis aren't going to win awards for any of their writing, but it's done well enough to at least drive the story in the right direction. And if you can retain the spirit of your inner 12-year-old and suspend your own disbelief, you'll enjoy Speed Racer as much as I did. There really is no better way to describe the movie than an exact live-action conversion of the Speed Racer cartoon. As long as you keep that in your mind going in, you'll walk out thoroughly entertained. After seeing it twice, I think I've come enjoy this as much as any of my favorite childhood cinematic experiences. Emile Hirsch, Matthew Fox, and Rain all star as three rival racers who must learn to work together in Speed Racer. In comparison, Speed Racer isn't as finely crafted as either Iron Man or The Matrix, but it has a distinctive style and that's where the Wachowski's always shine. Emile Hirsch does a formidable job as Speed, considering almost everything in the film was CGI. Matthew Fox was underutilized as Racer X, which is a shame since he had the greatest depth out of anyone in the cast. Christina Ricci as Speed's girlfriend Trixie, Susan Sarandon as Mom Racer, and Paulie Litt as Spritle were all mildly serviceable as well. The cast isn't what this is going to remembered for and that's not a real problem. Speed Racer is an action film aimed squarely at the 12-year-old in all of us. Everyone who can step out of their own age and enjoy what the Wachowskis have created will be overjoyed by this movie. It has captured the spirit of pure cartoon entertainment and ensconced it in a glorious, stylish, candy-coated world as only the Wachowski Brothers can. Speed Racer is a movie I've come to love after two viewings and is easily a movie I won't forget. The Wachowskis haven't created the next Matrix, they've created the perfect adaptation of a Saturday morning cartoon. And I can't stop waking up in the mornings to watch it.",CMJ_Doc5_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Positive,Speed_Racer
95,CMJ_Doc6_SpeedRacer,"After the debacle of the Matrix trilogy - in the final third of which the directors' reputations declined exponentially, like a batting collapse in English cricket - the Wachowski brothers are back. But their minds are clearly more frazzled than ever. The deafeningly loud and stroboscopically flashy film they have brought us is a feature-length version of the Japanese anime series about a super-fast racecar driver called Speed Racer. That is: his first name is Speed and his surname is Racer; Speed is what Mr and Mrs Racer have called him and it does not appear to be a nickname. His elder brother's first name is merely Rex, which appears to indicate that his parents believed that racing was the younger sibling's destiny. Anyway, Emile Hirsch, an actor with a kind of young Elvis beauty, plays Speed, who races in the weird and wonderful sci-fi arenas in this Japanimated alternative-reality world, the cars clattering and careening madly around, often in the diagonal ""Tokyo Drift"" style, sometimes achieving vertical takeoff, sometimes apparently able to whizz straight through other cars like ghosts. Roger Allam plays Royalton, the evil corporate bully who wants to crush indie-minded racers such as Speed and his mechanic dad Pops (John Goodman). Christina Ricci plays girlfriend Trixie, with whom Speed has a weirdly platonic, almost sibling relationship, and Matthew Fox, from TV's interminable Lost, plays the mysterious masked Racer X. Speed also has a tyke-ish kid brother, who in turn has a pet chimp; they are both so irritating I wanted to tie them to the track and run them over in the nearest Ferrari. Everything takes place in a cartoony, Day-Glo, digitised universe, with all the actors performing in front of a green-screen. The oranges and blues and greens and reds are too intense, as if on an old-fashioned television with the contrast dial turned up too high. It's like watching a 3-D movie without the 3-D glasses, and this in fact is the kids'-TV visual style that Robert Rodriguez once experimented with in his Spy Kids period. It's often baffling. Some of the actors are Australian. Roger Allam's character, though an evil Brit, appears also to be German. Go figure. It's also occasionally intriguing in an exotic and bizarre way, though the speed scenes don't have the mad chutzpah of the contra-flow highway chase sequence from Matrix Reloaded. There is a very dreamy moment in which the cars seem to attempt a massive loop-the-loop section of track, which is suddenly viewed as it were in long-shot, with the distant metal ring surreally juxtaposed with a stately flamingo. Sometimes it's strange in an, erm, not-good way. Christina Ricci's face in this movie has an unearthly quality, as if the Wachowskis have found some way of disassembling every molecule of her body and reformulating it as digital pixels. Her skin looks like a pioneering bio-plastic mix being produced somewhere on the Planet Zog. You have to be 12 to like it, and I have to say there is little or nothing here to remind us why we were all quite so excited about The Matrix. But there's nothing to rule out Andy and Larry Wachowski returning in the future with something to astound us once more.",CMJ_Doc6_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Negative,Speed_Racer
96,CMJ_Doc7_SpeedRacer,"""Speed Racer,"" the Wachowski Brothers' first film as writer-directors since ""The Matrix Reloaded"" five years ago, is a dizzying pop-art confection. Inspired by the 1960s Japanese-made animated series, the movie integrates live action and kaleidoscopic digital effects to create a highly artificial, color-saturated fantasy world where race cars come equipped with retractable weaponry and battle it out like spinning tops (or the ""beyblades"" popularized by more recent manga). Twelve-year-old boys should be wowed, but for the rest of us, it will depend on your appetite for eye candy. ""Speed Racer"" is sweet, but decidedly overlong and determinedly innocuous. Weaving between past and present with rare finesse, the opening scenes establish that we're entering a little boy's daydream. Speed Racer (played as a kid by Nicholas Elia, and subsequently by Emile Hirsch) is struggling with a math equation when his mind begins to wander. As well it might: Pops (John Goodman) designs race cars and older brother Rex drives them -- brilliantly. No wonder it's all Speed can think about. When Rex perishes in a crash, it's a foregone conclusion that Speed will follow in his tire tracks. But even as a young man he soon discovers the sports world is more complex than he imagined: He's schmoozed by the CEO of Royalton (Roger Allam), a big money corporate sponsor. When Speed rejects his offer, Royalton angrily insists the sport is a sham and he'll never win a race. The Wachowskis like to pay lip service to subversive ideas in their scripts (which also include ""V for Vendetta"" and rewrites on last year's Nicole Kidman bomb ""The Invasion""), and on some level ""Speed Racer"" is clearly meant to have a bit of ""The Matrix"" for kids, with suggestions of a paranoid postmodern fable about what Royalton calls ""the power and unassailable might of money."" Mostly, though, the Wachowskis just get a kick out of replicating the splashy, wide-eyed innocence of the anime universe, which is itself an even more idealized image of the nuclear family than you find in the American cartoons that influenced the Japanese. The Racer brood extends to Speed's girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), his mischievous younger brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), the pet chimpanzee Chim Chim, and even a resident mechanic, Sparky (Kick Gurry). Although it's not set in a specific time and place, the environment, the clothes and the language -- ""Cool beans"" -- is redolent of the sitcom suburbia that was a product of the Eisenhower years: ""The Jetsons"" via Roy Lichtenstein. The way the Wachowskis shoot this world it might as well be a rear projection, but it's a rear projection they evidently find appealing. It is possible to feel nostalgia for a lost utopia, the future we used to believe in that never quite materialized. The races are dizzying switchback affairs, closer to virtual kung fu than NASCAR. The longest is a cross-country rally/demolition derby which seems indebted to another late '60s cartoon, ""The Wacky Racers."" In one typically oddball gag, a rival driver attempts to knock out Speed by catapulting a beehive into his path. But for all the movie's visual panache -- and there's plenty -- there are precious few laughs and little suspense. It's almost impossible to care about Speed or the outcome of his races. Not because he's not heroic, but because he's as synthetic as everything else in this virtual entertainment. The old cartoon was frequently silly and empty, too, but at least it was over in a half-hour.",CMJ_Doc7_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Negative,Speed_Racer
97,CMJ_Doc8_SpeedRacer,"Maybe every generation gets its own “Tron.” “Speed Racer” comes to us from the creators of “The Matrix,” and as my cerebral cortex was reeling from the onslaught of its jelly-belly colors and “Lucy in the Sky” graphics, I wondered if there was some parallel universe where it might be considered an entertaining experience. Maybe Japan? This adventurously awful film is awful in many ways at once. It is, like a Ferrari poking across East 42nd Street at rush hour, fast yet slow. It is futuristically retro. Its attention span is measurable in microseconds, yet it runs more than two hours. And it spent a trillion dollars imitating the look of a 10-cent cartoon from the primitive ’60s – artistically, the Cro-Magnon era. I was initially awed by its splendors. But when I’d had my fill, there was still an hour-45 left. Not to whine, but by the end, my eyeballs were on fire. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch of “Into the Wild”) comes from a family with a large carbon footprint. His dad, Pops (John Goodman), makes fast cars, assisted by Mom (Susan Sarandon). His older brother, a champion driver himself, dies young. Perhaps he couldn’t bear living a moment longer knowing that – with the last name Racer and parents who were willing to use Speed as a given name – they saved it for the next kid and stuck him with “Rex.” Vowing to carry on Rex Racer’s Earnhardt-esque legacy, Speed hits the racetrack in the opening minutes for a zoomy action scene in which he has a chance to break his brother’s records. Much like the other big set pieces in the movie, the race blasts colors and shapes all over the screen. This could well be the most dazzling thing you’ve ever seen – or it could make you long for the relative serenity of Saturday night at the disco. Either way, it’s hard to stay interested when the race keeps breaking off into flashbacks. This movie’s motto is cut to the exposition – or the monkey. Speed Racer has a little brother at home who is prone to getting in “comical” situations. I fence the word between quotation marks because the film does. No one is likely to laugh at the squirt as he (for instance) is awed by the sight of a candy display or attacks a ninja by adhering to his calf. Every time we check in on the scampering of the l’il tyke and his pet chimp – 20 minutes could have been saved by eliminating them – the racing thrills seem diminished by the jokey context. The Wachowski brothers call their movie motorized kung fu – “car fu” – but the monkey makes it more like Jar Jar Fu. This is the costliest piece of camp ever manufactured. Speed is offered a sponsorship by an evil CEO from the Royalton Corp., who uses his stable of talent in a scheme to fix races that affects the price of oil. The CEO spends about 10 minutes explaining this in a scene that has all the narrative pull of the commodities pricing chart in the Financial Times. Instead of joining the dark side, Speed joins forces with his girlfriend (Christina Ricci) and former rivals Taejo (played by the Korean pop star Rain) and Racer X, a character who has the misfortune to be played by the monotonous Matthew Fox. He’s costumed in one of the shoddiest outfits modeled by a comic-book type since the Riddler pranced around the 1960s “Batman” TV show in green polyester pajamas with question marks printed on them. Racer X, whose true identity is shrouded, looks like a crossing guard at a school for dorks. The racers set off on a cross-country rally against cheating rivals who try to harpoon Speed’s tires or send him skittering off an icy cliff. But each time Speed has an answer: He pushes a button, and the car sprouts shields out of its hubcaps or drops its wounded tires and instantly inflates new ones. Spectacular as this sequence is, with awesome digital landscapes ranging from desert to Brandenburg Gate, it’s basically a video game fed by hyperactivity instead of interactivity. The movie makes you crave a streamlined story, interesting characters and a joystick.",CMJ_Doc8_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Negative,Speed_Racer
98,CMJ_Doc9_SpeedRacer,"I was 4 years old when the original Speed Racer first landed on American television, arriving at the vanguard of a Japanese anime invasion that continues unabated to this day. My youngest, a second-grader, has watched it on DVD and is well versed in the world of the snazzy Mach 5 racecar and its loyal driver, Speed. This makes both of us qualified to pass judgment on its transformation into a spit-shined 21st-century summer vehicle. He liked it, with reservations. I didn't, with concessions to its verve. It made him smile. It made me groan. Vive le generation gap. Written and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski (who haven't worn both hats since 2003's The Matrix Revolutions), Speed Racer is a long, large-budgeted, aggressively hyper attempt to bring the old show into the era of green-screen filmmaking. For a start, they cast sharp actors in several geek-iconic roles: Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild) as Speed Racer; Christina Ricci as Speed's plucky girlfriend, Trixie; Paulie Litt as his beanie-headed kid brother, Spritle; John Goodman as Pops; Susan Sarandon as Mom; and Matthew Fox (Lost) as the misterioso Racer X. The irrelevant plot involves race fixing and Dickensian-style bad guys in porkpie hats. When I asked my son to explain what he liked best about the movie, he replied: ""The cool stuff - the races. And the kid and the monkey.'' (Well, chimpanzee.) I'll agree that the race scenes are crazy cool, a computerized whirlwind of low-slung cars on snaking turns and vertiginous loop-de-loops lit like a Ferris wheel at night. Spritle is indeed a hoot. And the chimp has a cute grin. In deference to the original, Hirsch projects bland filial probity while wearing skinny pants and the occasional Eurotrashy neck scarf. Roger Allam, hamming it up as a slimeball industrialist E.P. Arnold Royalton, shows off a smashing array of purples and golds. The movie's palette is garish by design, incorporating every color that's ever seen the inside of an M&M bag. The Wachowskis have built their Speed Racer with the look a Saturday-morning cartoon: They nest live actors inside computer-generated cars and settings while layers of imagery shift behind and above and around them, both foregrounds and backgrounds sharply in focus. The thing is never at rest. Never. It gave me a headache, a stomach ache and the less-defined unease that comes from witnessing a major change in the zeitgeist. Because the zeitgeist, judging from this movie, now embraces rattle-headed visual delirium at all costs. It embraces an approach to cinema that shuns plainspoken clarity and structure for the jittery edits and splintered narrative devices of the video-gaming industry. At film's close, Speed and Trixie are puckered up and poised to kiss when Spritle jumps in with a very funny fourth-wall alert for ""cootie-sensitive viewers.'' But those prone to seizures should also take heed, because watching Speed Racer provides (I'm speculating) the same neural buzz as being trapped for 134 minutes inside a giant spinning lava lamp. And my son? ""Nothing is too much for me,'' he said. But when I asked him what he didn't like about the movie, his answer was a litany of too muches: too much boring grown-up talk; too much confusion as the story bumps from present to past; too many scenes in which someone gets to monologuing while flashbacks whip past at lighting speed. ""That was annoying,'' he declared. The kid's too young for the Matrix trilogy, or he might have spotted an old Wachowski weak spot for clangorous graphic overkill - a tendency to throw every available CG gimmick onto the screen just because they can. As Pops says to Royalton, ""People like you have way too much money. They start thinkin' that the rules everybody else plays by don't mean squat to them.'' Agreed.",CMJ_Doc9_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Negative,Speed_Racer
99,CMJ_Doc10_SpeedRacer,"Watching ""Speed Racer,"" the new summer lollapalooza from the Wachowski brothers, is like being force-fed a Costco-size bag of your favorite candy. For half an hour, taste buds you didn't know you had are firing in delirium, stoked by the movie's outrageous visual razzle-dazzle. Then you hit that spot in the bag where you know you should stop, but the movie keeps going. You feel more and more bloated; the movie keeps going. At a certain point, you may wonder if the movie's eating you. It doesn't end so much as vomit the audience out. That's entertainment, I suppose, or an experience, or a night out at the movies on acid. In ""Speed Racer,"" millions of dollars and billions of computer cycles have been expended creating a digital wonder-world simulacrum - an unimaginably amped-up, CGI-enhanced live action version of the beloved 1960s Japanese anime many of us remember from US airings on upper-dial broadcast and cable stations (Channel 56 in Boston for me, a half-eaten Space Stick in my hand). The show, created by Tatsuo Yoshida, was in the mold of Osamu Tezuka's groundbreaking ""Astro Boy"": flat, fast, catchy, hilariously dubbed in all italics. Boy car-fanatic Speed Racer drove his Mach 5 against colorful opponents with hidden tire-knives, while girlfriend Trixie, parents Pops and Mom, little brother Spritle, and their pet chimp Chim-Chim screeched and swooned in the stands. Wonderful at 4 in the afternoon when you should be doing homework, but is there a movie in it? The Wachowskis - still trying to match ""The Matrix"" - respond by building a universe out of pixels and aiming for a massive sugar high. The skies are a cobalt digital blue here, the clouds on loan from Teletubbyland. The racetracks, blissfully, defy all engineering logic, and the cars flip and careen with 800-horsepower abandon (producer Joel Silver has dubbed the action sequences ""Car Fu""). The time period is the 1960s seen through the nostalgic GAF View-Master of a 21st century graphic designer - it's future retro. The sensibility is Hot Wheels on industrial steroids. My inner 7-year-old was having atrial fibrillations. There are people here, sort of. ""Speed Racer"" drops human actors into its breathless visual schema like drops of water on a hot griddle: Emile Hirsch as Speed, Christina Ricci as Trixie, Susan Sarandon and John Goodman as Mom and Pops. Hirsch is appropriately wooden - any trace of his ""Into the Wild"" passion has been sandblasted off - and Ricci appears to have lost more than 50 percent of her body weight; she's all chin and mischievous saucer-eyes. The movie's the wayward grandchild of ""Tron,"" the 1982 Disney film that doodled primitive computer graphics over actors like Jeff Bridges. The intentionally banal plot barely merits a mention, but here goes: Speed resists the enticements of a swishy, omnipotent tycoon (Roger Allam, channeling late-period Tim Curry) and schemes to expose him with the help of the not-so-mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox of ""Lost,"" looking dandy in his bondage mask), Japanese racer Taejo (Rain), and the dauntless Inspector Detector (Benno Fürmann). It's a corporate power fantasy about the evils of corporate power, basically; an irony the filmmakers flatten in their race to the finish. ""Speed Racer"" screeches to a halt every so often for boilerplate inspirational speeches - reprised toward the end in a goofy, greatest-hits montage - and for cutesy slapstick involving Spritle (Paulie Litt) and the chimpanzees playing Chim-Chim (less amusing if you credit rumors of animal abuse on the German shooting locations). Mostly, the Wachowskis rev the movie's motor in geometrically increasing RPMs, building inexorably to a climax that can only be described as NASCAR Zen orgasm. Aiming to replicate the experience of the anime on a metastasized scale, ""Speed Racer"" unsnaps the characters from the frame and lets them deliver their lines on floating multiple planes of action, constantly wiping this way and that like cars playing chicken on a crowded freeway. It's enthralling, and then it's exhausting, and it never lets up. On the levels of technical craftsmanship and pure eye-candy, ""Speed Racer"" is some kind of triumph of the will. It has a knowing foot in pop art as well - the movie could be a Roy Lichtenstein canvas using pixels instead of zipatone dots. It's also thunderingly, proudly empty in a way that prompts either total submission or thoughts of resistance. The movie demands you be a glutton for sensation and then has the nerve to ask why you're not hungrier.",CMJ_Doc10_SpeedRacer,CMJ,Action,Negative,Speed_Racer
100,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"There's a nice little 90-minute B movie trapped inside the 143 minutes of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" a movie that charms the audience and then outstays its welcome. Although the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the movie feels like it already includes the sequel; maybe that explains the double-barreled title. It's a good thing that Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp are on hand to jack up the acting department. Their characters, two world-class goofballs, keep us interested even during entirely pointless swordfights.
Pointless? See if you can follow me here. Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp) has a deep hatred for Capt. Barbossa (Rush), who led a mutiny aboard Sparrow's pirate ship, the Black Pearl, and left Capt. Jack stranded on a deserted island. Barbossa and his crew then ran afoul of an ancient curse that turned them into the Undead. By day they look like normal if dissolute humans, but by the light of the moon, they're revealed as skeletal cadavers. Now here's the important part: Because they're already dead, they cannot be killed. Excuse me for supplying logic where it is manifestly not wanted, but doesn't that mean there's no point in fighting them? There's a violent battle at one point between the Black Pearl crew and sailors of the Royal Navy, and unless I am mistaken the sailors would all eventually have to be dead because the skeletons could just keep on fighting forever, until they won. Yes? The only reason I bring this up is that the battle scenes actually feel as if they go on forever. It's fun at first to see a pirate swordfight, but eventually it gets to the point where the sword-clashing, yardarm-swinging and timber-shivering get repetitious. I also lost count of how many times Jack Sparrow is the helpless captive of both the British and the pirates, and escapes from the chains/brig/noose/island.
And yet the movie made me grin at times, and savor the daffy plot, and enjoy the way Depp and Rush fearlessly provide performances that seem nourished by deep wells of nuttiness. Depp in particular seems to be channeling a drunken drag queen, with his eyeliner and the way he minces ashore and slurs his dialogue ever so insouciantly. Don't mistake me: This is not a criticism, but admiration for his work. It can be said that his performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie. There's some talk about how he got too much sun while he was stranded on that island, but his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal. He is a peacock in full display.
Consider how boring it would have been if Depp had played the role straight, as an Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr. or Jr.) might have. To take this material seriously would make it unbearable. Capt. Sparrow's behavior is so rococo that other members of the cast actually comment on it. And yet because it is consistent and because you can never catch Depp making fun of the character, it rises to a kind of cockamamie sincerity.
Geoffrey Rush is relatively subdued--but only by contrast. His Barbossa, whose teeth alone would intimidate a congregation of dentists, brings gnashing to an art form.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Positive,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
101,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Jack Sparrow is one very strange pirate, and thank heaven for that. As Johnny Depp plays him, with Cockney accent, kohl-blackened eyes and a prancing brio that wouldn't be out of place in a Christopher Street parade, he's by far the best reason to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Depp gave us a glimpse of his comic finesse in the 1995 ""Don Juan DeMarco,"" and here--in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural--Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious.
Sparrow teams up with blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue the beautiful daughter (Keira Knightley) of the governor of Port Royal. She's been kidnapped by Sparrow's pirate nemesis, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who thinks she can dispel an ancient curse that has turned him and his greedy, grimy crew into the undead. And so on. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has its ups and downs, but it's better than a movie based on a theme-park ride has any right to be. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, tends to work best in its comic mode. After a while, the sea battles begin to feel redundant. Director Gore Verbinski's fight scenes between the good guys and the ghostly pirate warriors suffer from the same problem that afflicted ""The Matrix Reloaded"": how can you generate life-or-death suspense with characters who can't die? Fortunately, whenever the movie starts to sag, Depp flies to the rescue. It's a truly piratical performance: with his flamboyantly fluttering fingers he steals every scene in the movie. This comedy is well integrated into the story, helping us to get to know the characters and the relationships that arise between them, but always with the mind of offering the viewer pure popcorn entertainment of the first level. Only the film's PG-13 rating prevents him from doing unthinkable things to the heroine, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), whose blood, it is thought, can free the captain and his crew from the Curse of the Black Pearl.
Elizabeth is the daughter of Weatherby Swann, the governor (Jonathan Pryce) of Port Royal, a British base in the Caribbean, and seems destined to marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport), a fate which we intuit would lead to a lifetime of conversations about his constipation.
She truly loves the handsome young swordsmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), whom she met when they were both children, after spotting him adrift on a raft with a golden pirate medallion around his neck, which turns out to hold the key to the curse. Jack Sparrow takes a fatherly interest in young Turner, especially when he discovers who his father was ... and that is quite enough of the plot.
Bloom is well cast in a severely limited role as the heroic straight-arrow. He has the classic profile of a silent-film star. Knightley you will recall as the best friend of the heroine in ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" where she had a sparkle altogether lacking here.
Truth be told, she doesn't generate enough fire to explain why these swashbucklers would risk their lives for her, and in closeup, seems composed when she should smolder. Parminder K. Nagra, the star of ""Beckham,"" might have been a more spirited choice.
""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is ""based on"" the theme park ride at Disney World, which I have taken many times. It is also inspired (as the ride no doubt was) by the rich tradition of pirate movies, and excels in such departments as buried treasure, pirates' caves, pet parrots and walking the plank, although there is a shortage of eye patches and hooks.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Positive,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
102,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like ""Stop blowing holes in my ship,"" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.
This first of the Pirates Of The Caribbean series, Curse Of The Black Pearl was a milestone in the career of star Johnny Depp. I always liked Depp since 21 Jump Street and he always chose quirky products where he did great as an actor, but the films were more often than not less than successful commercially. With this film first and foremost Depp got himself linked to a commercial success that spawned several sequels. His box office was now secure.
But also this is a once in a lifetime chance to do a part that calls for some of the most outrageous overacting you'll ever see. I think Johnny Depp might have been channeling Robert Newton in one of his pirate films, be it Blackbeard or Treasure Island.
In fact the plot is a lot like Treasure Island in the sense that Depp is looking to get back his ship the Black Pearl. It was taken over by his former First Mate Barboso played by Geoffrey Rush and the whole crew Depp included is under a really bad curse. A couple of civilians, governor's daughter Keira Knightley and blacksmith Orlando Bloom are also part of the adventure.
The Pirates Of The Caribbean blends both the swashbuckling adventure film and the horror genre quite nicely. I can certainly Robert Newton in the part had this been 60-70 years ago. 
This is one film as are the rest in the series to just kick back and enjoy.
Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.
The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Positive,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
103,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Really good fun  doesn't take itself too seriously and is played to perfection by a wonderful Depp
bob the moo1 September 2003
Sailing with her father as a girl, Elizabeth Swann, is on board when the military ship comes across a wreck from which they rescue only a young boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth hides the boy's medallion in order to hide the fact that he is a pirate, she also thinks she sees the mysterious ship The Black Pearl. Years later Elizabeth is being wooed by officers while Will is a blacksmith in her father's service. When her medallion calls out to another force, it brings the crew of the Pearl to the bay in search of the gold. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Will resolves to go after her. He turns to the only man he knows who knows the black pearl  incarcerated pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. However how can you trust a pirate's word?
I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film  I had been totally turned off by the trailer. The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line, it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer. However I did go and see it and, after Hulk and Matrix, I was very glad I did. The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest. It doesn't all make total sense but, like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.
Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned, POTC doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't make fun of itself either, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time. This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue, action and characters  the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.
As every other reviewer on earth has said, the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack. Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft, Depp wrings so much humour out of every line, every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line). It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun. The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny, sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.
Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job. Both do well however and are good if not quite stars  certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film. Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun. The effects are used just as they should always be used  to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre! The effects are good without replacing plot or characters  they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).
Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal. Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one, but it does exactly what a summer film should be  entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals. Having said that, if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser. His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier, livelier and all round fun experience.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Positive,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
104,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"And he has a great entrance. A really great one, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! Even if it's only the first scene with Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow! While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.
But kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie ""genre"" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now! A great adventure with a crazy/great guy in the middle of it!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! That's what I feel like having watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl""! I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too.
It all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage.
Enter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. ""POTC: TCOTBP"" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus ""Mouse Hunt"" and ""The Ring"" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me...
Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with eccentric pirate ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.
Although he has been around since the early 1980s, and has made such great films as ""Edward Scissorhands"", this is now the role Depp is best known for. And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in ""Into the Woods"" has its charms).
Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie. Even if the soundtrack existed and the screen was blank, the film would deserve credit just for the score. Not many films could claim this, but ""Pirates"" can.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Positive,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
105,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in My opinion is not one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't.
The following is in My opinion.
1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him.
2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one.
3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why?
4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed.
5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke?
You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Negative,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
106,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"Well, I have to say, this movie was such an exciting experience!!!!! I rented this one stormy night on DVD and boy, this movie was so exciting!!!!! This movie, of course, is based on the theme park ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I liked all the action and stuff in there; it was awesome!!!!! I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers (""Is that a plane?????"" - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from ""Walt Disney Presents,"" which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998.

Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!)

This is a ""BAD PERIOD"" movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A ""Disney"" movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!! So basically, Disney now robs of its usual audience in the ""Bad Period.""

""PIRATE DVDS OF THE EAST: THE CURSE OF THE MPAA'S FOCUS"" is a film that, while it appeals to us adults, JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO CHILDREN!!!!! Bad idea! -1000000/10 for making a grown company cry!!!!!
Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure.

The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious.

It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD.

Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.

Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.

His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.

Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.

As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.

If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Negative,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
107,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"I can not remember the last time I saw a Disney film that was as bad as this is. Why do people who have had no acting lessons and are not fully trained actors continually get acting work at the expense of those that have been fully trained and therefore can act? Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves! 

There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good about this generic pirate film. It had two story lines in it both of them having been told and shown countless times in far better ways numerous times before I wouldn't be at all surprised. OK so I Told a lie when I said there was absolutely nothing good about the film, as there was on thing good about it, the closing/end credits! Once they come on it means, thankfully, this extremely boring, exceedingly tedious film that has been stre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-tched to as long as it can be can now be switched off!
Is this a story that inspires, captivates and entrances? That's what it's creators think it is. And far too many gullible viewers think that this is art.

But what is great about it? A little bit of swashbuckling action to begin with, and nothing new. Then the whole pursuit, cove, cave thing. Not only was the storyline descending into the abyss but so was the film. Really, what was all that cave foolishness worth? Not my time.

With the talent and the budget sunk into this project, 3/4 of the directors alive today with a good writer in tow could have made this into a movie!
The old pirate movies put this one to shame. The main couple is so dislikable with babbling honorably sounding dialogue but without showing one shred of goodness that you expect in a pirate movie. This is also reflected in the script, which makes them act as if with good intentions, but when you reflect, only to make them look good. Naturally the end is incredibly cheesy, events without motivation, impossible action, and quite good special effects and big breasts to keep the eye interested.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Negative,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
108,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it ""The best"". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great. Great visuals, a nice interesting story, good performances, good make up, but it is still and will be another blockbuster film. 7.56/100
Disclaimer: I saw a moderately crappy cam-version with a crappy dub (50% translation, 50% own creation).

Most people seem to enjoy this flick and I guess that chances are that you will too. I saw it (better to say some parts of it) yesterday and to say I was disappointed is to say nothing. After about one hour my dad said he can't bear it anymore and walked out. I followed him, but later returned, since I had to kill time somehow. My mother and 19 y.o. sister moderately enjoyed it (or may be just thought it would get better), but after less than two hours said they will watch it sometime later (read 'never') and stopped it.

Well, my impression was that the movie was pretty stupid and cliche. May be not the worst script, but nothing to write home about. The acting was either over the top (Johnny Depp) or bland and boring (everyone else). There might have been some brilliant special effects that I missed on the cam-copy, but I doubt it. There was hardly any sea worth looking at, and everything else was taken out of the Hollywood library of generic effects.

If you have nothing better to do, see it on the big screen, may be it will look cool (it probably won't). Don't pay much for the tickets, though.
this movie sucks , its way too long kind of boring and a very crappy ending. the only thing that saved this movie was johnny depp . the only reason this movie made alot of money is because it was a ride at disneyland . WOW , that is so exciting , actually no it isnt this movie is the worst film i have seen ever , god i want that 2 and a half hours of my life back , and my 8 dollars , well all i have is 4 words: i hate this movie
Terrible, repelling and completely unwatchable. It makes the first Mummy look like a masterpiece. Even the visual effects are terrible and ugly to look at. And Johnny Depp's performance was bad in every way. Just because you manage to speak in a way that is hard to understand does not mean it is good acting. What was the Academy thinking have they completely lost their mind. As much as I thought Return of the King was ridiculously overrated after this abomination I am starting to respect it. After such a bad decade of bad and unoriginal movies people must have broken critical fuse and mistaken this atrocity for a great movie. When will James Cameron finally start making movies and resurrect Cinema.

109,IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I want that 2 hours of my life back. It is extremely predictable and written by a formula. Depp did his usual strong performance, but I wonder if he actually read the script before agreeing to do the movie. My guess is that he was looking for a money maker and the Disney logo spelled cash. It must be expensive living in France. Even though Depp performed well, the persistent intentional head bobbing was annoying. It could have been understandable if there was anything resembling a story.
How sad. I was so looking forward to this movie. I love Pirate Lore. From the director of that smash hit The Mexican, this movie sucked. It should have gotten more Disney treatment, or none at all. The story was so shallow, the characters were so shallow, that it would have maybe been a terribly entertaining film for the kids, but the movie was too dark and violent for the little ones. I thought Depp would work wonders with this, but the script was so inane. There wasn't enough meat for the adults. I didn't care at all about any of the characters. I kept wating to hear ""Ding, please turn the page."" 

Some nice moments, but just a few. Over all, a let down. Rent the Musketeer for swordplay, or rent Mutiny for munity. As for pirates, even the Pirate Movie starring Kristie McNichol was more engaging than this. And it was a musical.
There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself...

Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.

Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.
im pretty surprised that this is actually on the top 250 list, and ahead of some pretty impressive films.

I was dissapointed to say the least, when putting the disc in the dvd i thought to myself ""a good ol fashioned, pirate ghost tale, marvelous"".... ah no... suffice to say the peak was when i got a chuckle out of the scene where you see Depp standing tall and proud as he jumps down on what you expect to be a massive ship but turns out to be a dinky sailboat. That was about 5 minutes into the movie, it all went down from there. It was just boring to me, pirates who were cursed and now need the blood of a certain fellow to lift it, whoooo. Orlando Bloom was annoying, I can understand pre teenage girls waving their ""Potc"" flags because hes oh so hot(those would be the imdb users with reviews like, ""omigawd this is like tha best movie EVER, orlando bloom rules!!!111"".

My confirmation came when my sweet mother, who never has a bad word to say about anyone or anything proclaimed, ""it wasnt really good"", when an hour rolled around we had both lost all interest and i was reading comic books, glancing at the tv now and then to see if anything interesting pops up. It didnt. Finally, I fell asleep.",IKL_Doc1_PiratesOfTheCaribbean:TheCurseOfTheBlackPearl,IKL,Action,Negative,Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Curse_of_the_Black_Pearl
110,SPM_Doc1_CasinoRoyale,"Bond is back. Bond is beefy. And the new Bond is blond. Daniel Craig (Munich) has comfort ably slipped into the tuxedo, size 007, and left audiences shaken and stirred.

Director Martin Campbells (The Mask of Zorro, Golden Eye) interpretation of Ian Flemings Casino Royale, which reveals Bonds early career, begins with a black and white sequence that shows how he graduated from secret agent to a Double-O.

His first assignment as 007 is to bust Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), banker to the worlds terrorist. When Bond foils Le Chiffres plans to sink an airline stock price and rake in the winnings, the latter arranges a super high stakes poker game to win back the terrorists money. M (Judi Dench) enrols Bond for the game, and the masterplan (however lame) is that he will outwit Le Chiffre and win over all the money.

Accompanying him on this mission, like a ball and chain, is Treasury representative Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) whose mandate is to protect the governments millions.

Vesper thaws Bonds heart and is Casino Royales designated Bond babe. Oddly, among the chases, fights, stunts and poker moves, Bond and Vesper de velop an attraction, which brings an unfamiliar characteristic to 007  hes actually sensitive and sappy  a little hard to swallow, even it comes with a twist.

Also Green is not the typical Bond girl  shes a little school mistress-like and seems keener on talking to Bond rather than romping with him. Bonds trademark playfulness is definitely in short supply here.

Bond gambles at the poker table, gambles with his life and then gambles on his woman  all leading to violent and dramatic consequences that establish the Bond he will go on to be.

While theres a new Bond here (one with a soft side), many of the old tricks are still in place  the not-so-subtle product placements, the fast cars (Aston Martin DBS), the Martini (but with a new recipe) and a fitting adversary in Le Chiffre, played ably by Danish actor Mikkelsen.

Judi Dench is at her caustic and collected best, Eva Green does not really win the audiences heart and we really missed Q and his collection of hi-tech gadgets.

Mostly Casino Royale is about whether the producers bet on the right actor for Bond, and it would seem they did. Craig is British to the core, slightly mischievous, has a gorgeous body (he takes his shirt off enough and is even tortured in the buff) and pulls off the action sequences with ease. The stunt sequence when hes giving a bomb maker chase early in the film is riveting.

Craig looks like hes here to stay. But heres hoping that in the next film some of Bonds quirks, flirtations and the aloofness associated with a slightly mysterious MI6 agent, return, gadgets and all.",SPM_Doc1_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Positive,Casino_Royale
111,SPM_Doc2_CasinoRoyale,"The introduction of a new James Bond always brings skepticism, and one of the major problems of Bond's 21st official cinematic adventure is that the skepticism remains when the final credits roll. Some will pick on the easy target: Daniel Craig, the new physical incarnation of Bond. Craig, a blond-haired, blue-eyed Brit, is not the type we typically associate with 007, and backlash against his casting sprang immediately upon his connection to the role. Honestly, it's petty, since it's what he does with role that's important, not how he looks. Craig is actually a great choice for the new Bond persona of Casino Royale; it's the new spin on the character from screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis that leaves doubts. Their Bond is more low-rent thug than suave cosmopolitanmore government assassin than super spy. He is, essentially, without personality, and it is to Craig's credit that he tries his best to instill some charm into a charmless role. Since the movie is an obvious attempt to restart the franchise from the beginning (actually using Ian Fleming's first Bond novel as its inspiration) and the character is just starting to develop, the decision makes sense, but the movie suffers because of it nonetheless.

The movie opens with Bond acquiring his ""00"" status by killing two men. Somewhere in Africa, a man with one useful eye named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) takes some money from so-called freedom fighters. Bond, meanwhile, is in Madagascar, tracking down terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) to retrieve information from him. After an extended chase that leads him to kill Mollaka and blow up part of a foreign embassy, Bond is obviously not on MI6 leader M's (Judi Dench) best side. Bond decides to decipher information retrieved from the terrorist on his own and makes his way to the Bahamas as a rogue agent. There Bond finds Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian), who helps with the execution of terrorist activities, and his wife Solange (Caterina Murino).. After some wooing of Solange, Bond discovers Dimitrios' plans involving the destruction of a new jet airliner in Miami. That plan, of course, is thwarted by 007, and Bond is back slightly on M's good side, leading her to let him join a high-stakes, no-limit hold-'em poker game run by Le Chiffre at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. The catch: Bond must answer to the Treasury Department's liaison Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).

Clearly, a lot is happening in the plot, and as per usual, most of it makes little to no sense. Occasionally, the script's weaving and winding, double-cross-filled plot is frustrating and sloppy, especially when Bond seems to have an extrasensory knowledge of who the real villains are before any evidence arises. A good chunk of the story revolves around the poker game, and director Martin Campbell never achieves any worthwhile tension in these scenes. There's one of the movie's four action sequences, a chase in a stairwell, randomly thrown in the middle of the poker plot to spice things up, but it feels forced. The other action sequences fare much better. Instead of the gadget-heavy, exaggerated action to which we've become accustomed, the sequences here are based slightly more in reality. The lengthy chase in Madagascar succeeds the most, with Bond and Mollaka running and climbing up the steel of a construction site. Another has Bond hanging on for dear life to a truck rigged to explode as a terrorist attempts to knock him off. The climax is a shoot-out in a building collapsing into the canals of Venice, which provides an added dynamic to what could be pretty standard stuff.

Other than the story's weak points, there's also the problem that, while Le Chiffre has a creepy gimmick in the form of tear ducts that bleed, Bond's arch-nemesis finds himself at the mercy of other, lesser characters more than once. He's a generic villain and, at best, a mild threat to our hero. One distressing scene has Le Chiffre torturing Bond (it involves a nude Bond, strapped to a chair with no bottom, and a length of rope), and while it gives the villain a bit more menace, the scene is more intriguing for the fact that Bond shows inklings of masochism. The notion is one of the better character moments for a Bond who hardly talks, especially early in the movie, and it gives Craig one of many chances to allude to Bond's darker side. This brooding Bond is sometimes refreshing, but there might be too much of it here. It's a wise move to show Bond in love here to balance his character, and Eva Green is positively stunning in the role. Throughout the course of the movie, there are hints of the charismatic character we've become used to, but by the end, Bond seems to be on his way to a permanent stay in the shadows of his pain.

Where this new vision of the series is heading could have promise, and it's good this is not a prequel. A character like Bond should already be pretty well-defined after 20 movies, and an origin story is almost a trivial exercise, really. It doesn't have to be, of course, but that's what Casino Royale ultimately feels like.",SPM_Doc2_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Negative,Casino_Royale
112,SPM_Doc3_CasinoRoyale,"Although box office has remained strong worldwide, even some of the most ardent fans of the James Bond series felt the series reached a creative low with the last two films starring Pierce Brosnan as 007, 1999's The World Is Not Enough and 2002's Die Another Day.  For me, though, the slump goes back to 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies, but that one seemed to go over better with Bond aficionados.
The last film I liked in the series was the first of the Brosnan Bonds, 1995's Goldeneye, which happens to be the last film original Bond producer Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli had any input on (although uncredited) in any shape or form.  But after Cubby died in 1996, the quality of the series headed south quickly despite remaining highly profitable.  Cubby was clearly the major creative force behind the Bond franchise who made it work.
All the subsequent Bond films after Cubby's death have been produced by his stepson, Michael G. Wilson, and his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, who both collaborated on several of the films with their father dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.  But with Cubby gone, the magic is gone as well.
Casino Royale was Ian Fleming's first 007 novel published in England back in 1953 and it was previously made into a god-awful 1967 all-star comedy spoof that went through five directors and 10 (not all credited) screenwriters, but also featured a great musical score by Burt Bacharach.  There is even an earlier TV version from 1954 (when the book was published in the U.S.) where actor Barry Nelson (the man who hands the keys to the Overlook Hotel to Jack Nicholson in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining) plays Jimmy Bond and Peter Lorre plays the villain.
Not counting the '67 comedy version of Casino Royale and 1983's Never Say Never Again, the new serious interpretation of Casino Royale is the 21st ""official"" James Bond film produced by EON Productions, the company Cubby co-founded with his production partner, Harry Saltzman, who left the series in 1975.
After the lackluster previous three Bond entries starring Brosnan, I had high hopes for the new Casino Royale because it was being billed as a ""grittier"" Bond film, and the last two times Bond ""returned to basics,"" it resulted in what are possibly my two favorites of the entire series, 1989's Licence to Kill and 1981's For Your Eyes Only.  Furthermore, Casino Royale had Martin Campbell returning to direct, and in my estimation, his first Bond film, Goldeneye, was the last enjoyable entry in the series.
Campbell's Casino Royale is indeed grittier, but unfortunately, it's only marginally better than the last three.  Unlike Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only, I think filmmakers got a little too down to earth for their own good this time, and, in turn, squeezed out a lot what's fun about these movies.  Licence to Kill and For Your Eyes Only had just the right balance of grit, wit and spectacular action.  The latest Bond, however, is overlong (its 144 minutes makes it the longest Bond to date), often sluggish and lacking in the kind of big, exciting action we've come to expect in Bond movies.
But on the plus side, Casino Royale contains no digital effects, which is refreshing after the previous two Bonds became overwhelmed with digital effects.
For those who thought Timothy Dalton's demeanor was too serious as Bond (I thought Dalton was just right for the role), Dalton is practically Roger Moore as compared to the latest Bond, blond-haired, blue-eyed Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Infamous), who plays the role with a stone-faced intensity more reminiscent of Charles Bronson.  Craig, though, isn't the problem.  The problem is that he's the centerpiece of an inconsistently paced film that goes on way too long and doesn't have enough action or suspense.
Furthermore, the latest Bond theme song, ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell, may very well be the most instantly forgettable in series history.
Since this is based on Fleming's first Bond novel, Casino Royale, like Batman Begins, is a return to the origins of the character in an attempt to revitalize a creaky franchise.  In the film, Craig's Bond has just recently been made a double 00 agent by his superior M (Judi Dench) and 007s first assignment is to neutralize a money launderer for terrorists named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen).  Bond's mission takes him from Uganda to the Bahamas to Miami to the Balkan States to Venice as he tracks the one-eyed, asthmatic, and, of course, sadistic Le Chiffre.
After joining forces with a fellow British agent (and eventual love interest) named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers), Bond and Le Chiffre finally come face to face during an international poker game where the British government stakes Bond in an attempt to bankrupt Le Chiffre by having Bond beat him at the gambling table.  This is also where Bond first meets his future long term CIA friend and contact Felix Leiter (played here by Jeffrey Wright) and gets introduced to what will become his signature drink, a martini, shaken not stirred.
It not until the very end that we first hear 007 utter his famous, ""Bond, James Bond"" line, and not until the end credits that we hear Bond's famous theme music.
Casino Royale has a couple of decent chase sequences, and Craig does have a strong screen presence, but just like the Cornell's theme song, most of what happens is instantly forgettable and nothing we haven't seen before.
From the results of EONs last four Bond films, this is clearly a worn-out franchise ready to be put out to pasture.  The man with the license to kill has become the man with the license to bore.",SPM_Doc3_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Negative,Casino_Royale
113,SPM_Doc4_CasinoRoyale,"Give or take the odd Octopussy, I suppose, like all of us, I've pretty much seen them all. My first, memorably - you never forget your first - was a rerun of Thunderball at a Gaumont in Birmingham, which in my memory was in the process of being demolished. I'd have been eight, and the most dramatic big screen extravanganza I'd seen previously was Swiss Family Robinson, so Bond came with something of the force of revelation; I went home to re-enact Sean Connery's underwater fight with Largo's men with a single rubber-suited Action Man in the bath.
My first on its proper release, not long after, was The Man with The Golden Gun, complete with Lulu's soundtrack. I had nightmares for a while about Christopher Lee's Scaramanga, and recall trying to join in with playground discussions about the voluptuous merits of Britt Eklund's Mary Goodnight in relation to Pussy Galore, a name whose reference was possibly still beyond me. I was, in any case, hooked, for a long time secretly thinking Roger Moore was the best Bond, a fact which would have dismayed my Dad who properly held out for the more spartan virtues of Sean Connery, and my Mum, who would sometimes make an impassioned, slightly flushed argument for the missed opportunity that was George Lazenby.
Anyhow, with some of this in mind, I went along to the Odeon Leicester Square on Friday night for the first screening of the new Bond, the Daniel Craig Bond. Most of the other balding, paunchy one-timeschoolboys in the queue seemed to have a similar not quite cynical sense of expectation. There'd be chases, and gadgets and gags - the last Bond line I'd heard in the cinema, was also one of the best: Pierce Brosnan, on the Bosphorus with Dr Christmas Jones at the end of The World is not Enough: 'I've always wanted to have Christmas in Turkey.'
Hopes were high. If nothing else, there would be John Barry's theme, which, as I joined the line to have my mobile phone confiscated - an emasculation I could never imagine 007 submitting to - was already dun-de-dunning in my head. The word before this screening was that Daniel Craig's Bond would be a purist's Bond, dirtier and grittier than recent smoothies. Casino Royale was the first of Fleming's books, and the only one, for contractual reasons, never previously filmed except in the Peter Sellers spoof. It would return James to his roots, the cold-blooded killer, the ex-wartime Commander, before fast women and invisible cars turned his head. It begins, after a title sequence involving the designs on the back of playing cards, and diamonds coming out of guns and writhing croupiers in silhouette - you know - in exactly that retro spirit, apparently in black and white, in Prague: Bond is in the shadows surprising a double agent rifling through a filing cabinet. Craig had effectively auditioned for Bond in Layer Cake, in which he played a cocaine dealer out of his depth, and we cut to what looks like a scene from that film - the very un-Bond-like graphic violence of Craig murdering an informer in a white-tiled public lavatory, holding the man's head underwater in a cheap sink. This, we are led to understand, was Bond's first kill, the most traumatic, his 007 status still pending, before the quips set in. His second, of the double agent by the filing cabinet, with a silencer, is more straightforward, and prompts a wry smile.
That grainy preamble over, Craig is in colour and up and running - straight through a staged cobra and mongoose fight in a market in Madagascar, over the odd trashed car, past plenty of startled villagers carrying unlikely dry goods, up some serious scaffolding scattering hard-hatted building workers, and on to a crane tower over the impossibly blue ocean in pursuit of a scar-faced villain with a bag of explosives. Who wants backstreet grittiness when you can have fights with guns that run out of bullets at opportune moments at high altitude?
Craig is the first Bond since Connery who looks more than capable of doing his own stunts, he runs like a streetfighter, falls credibly from great heights and has been practising his free running. This is pre-Q Bond; the closest he gets to a gadget is a decent mobile phone; he spends a good deal of his time chasing fast cars on foot in a manner Roger Moore would have deemed far too keen; to start with he doesn't even seem to have his own motor. Worse still, he hasn't yet earned Barry's theme, except in odd mangled chords.
The best preface to Casino Royale is Simon Winder's wonderful book The Man Who Saved Britain, out in paperback to coincide with the release of the film. It's the comic history of an obsession with Bond, both his own and our own - an unravelling of all the curious hang-ups about posh drinks and hat-throwing and casual misogyny that takes in the demise of imperial ambition, post-war austerity and Fleming's taste for torture. It's a brilliant deconstruction of those staples of British life that Paul Johnson, writing long ago of Bond in the New Statesmen, denounced as 'sex, snobbery and sadism', (this before Johnson moved to the Spectator and discovered the pleasures of the same).
You rather wish Cubby Broccoli and the rest had studied Winder's memoir before embarking on Casino Royale. One of the things his book argues well is that the explosion of a gas tanker is no real substitute for vaguely plausible plotting or some notion of contemporary relevance - a key element in Fleming's thrillers was his sharp move from villainous former Nazis, to Cold War paranoia.
In attempting to flesh out the idea of Daniel Craig's Bond as backstory to subsequent Bonds - trying on his first dinner jacket for size, tripping over his chat-up lines to Eva Green's gorgeous Vesper Lynd, replying when asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, 'Do I look like I give a damn?' - almost everything else seems to have gone out of the window (along with various not particularly sinister villains).
I'm quite happy for Bond to live in a continuous present, but the time frame of the film is perplexing. After the grainy Fifties Prague opening, there is the predictable Seventies, Whicker's World rush of destinations, taking in Uganda, Madagascar, the Bahamas and Venice, while Bond, who we are presumably supposed to believe we have never come across before, suggests from time to time that he is in 2006. Judi Dench as M, seems more than usually unsure about the wisdom of her role or which era she's in. She speaks at one point of her nostalgia for the Cold War, before outlining the plot, such as it is, which involves an attempt to manipulate the stock market using terrorism, bringing in the first and only reference to 9/11. You don't expect Casino Royale to be 24, quite, or Bond to be Jack Bauer, but it seems bizarre to be employing a mix of Albanian and Swiss and African and Italian financial terrorists when you might think there are more real current fears to explore.
Director Martin Campbell is also unsure about how much of the glamour of violence he wants to strip back. There are unusual 007 moments in which Bond lets us know he's human, sitting soaking in the shower in his blood-drenched dinner suit comforting Vesper after she has helped him kill a man; or, oddly, screaming in pain. Raymond Chandler praised the original book of Casino Royale for its brutal description of torture, exposing genre-fiction to a new realism. The scene that Chandler singled out is reproduced here, with Bond tied naked on the frame of a chair while his exposed scrotum is whipped with a knotted rope. Craig is, not surprisingly, in more obvious pain than any previous Bond , but having put him there, the only way to remove him is through a comically unexplained ambush; by the next scene, like the Bonds of old, he is recuperating by the Italian lakes, his tenderized tackle magically restored.
The problem with making Bond more real, is that everything around him then seems even more fake than usual. Craig, always a charismatic presence, often looks unsettled by that dislocation; his sex scenes are more energetic than those of his predecessors but even less convincing; he is hardly allowed any comedy. As a result, by the end of a curiously back-to-front film, when he finally gets his theme tune and introduces himself - 'Bond. James Bond' - he, like the creaky franchise itself, seems profoundly unsure whether he is coming or going.",SPM_Doc4_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Negative,Casino_Royale
114,SPM_Doc5_CasinoRoyale,"""Casino Royale"" has the answers to all my complaints about the 45-year-old James Bond series, and some I hadn't even thought of. It's not that I didn't love some of the earlier films, like some, dislike others and so on, as that I was becoming less convinced that I ever had to see another one.
This movie is new from the get-go. It could be your first Bond. In fact, it was the first Bond; it was Ian Fleming's first 007 novel, and he was still discovering who the character was. The longtime Saltzman-Broccoli producing team could never get their hands on the rights until now, despite earlier misadventures by others using the same title, and maybe it's just as well, because it provides a fresh starting place. And it returns to the family fold; with her father's passing, Barbara Broccoli is producer.
Yes, Daniel Craig makes a superb Bond: Leaner, more taciturn, less sex-obsessed, able to be hurt in body and soul, not giving a damn if his martini is shaken or stirred. That doesn't make him the ""best"" Bond, because I've long since given up playing that pointless ranking game; Sean Connery was first to plant the flag, and that's that. But Daniel Craig is bloody damned great as Bond, in a movie that creates a new reality for the character.
Year after year, attending the new Bond was like observing a ritual. There was the opening stunt sequence that served little purpose, except to lead into the titles; the title song; Miss Moneypenny; M with an assignment of great urgency to the Crown; Q with some new gadgets; an archvillain; a series of babes, some treacherous, some doomed, all frequently in stages of undress; the villain's master-plan; Bond's certain death, and a lot of chases. It could be terrific, it could be routine, but you always knew about where you were in the formula.
With ""Casino Royale,"" we get to the obligatory concluding lovey-dovey on the tropical sands, and then the movie pulls a screeching U-turn and starts up again with the most sensational scene I have ever seen set in Venice, or most other places. It's a movie that keeps on giving.
This time, no Moneypenny, no Q and Judi Dench is unleashed as M, given a larger role, and allowed to seem hard-eyed and disapproving to the reckless Bond. This time, no dream of world domination, but just a bleeding-eyed rat who channels money to terrorists. This time a poker game that is interrupted by the weirdest trip to the parking lot I've ever seen. This time, no laser beam inching up on Bond's netherlands, but a nasty knotted rope actually whacking his hopes of heirs.
And this time, no Monte Carlo, but Montenegro, a fictional casino resort, where Bond checks into the ""Hotel Splendid,"" which is in fact, yes, the very same Grand Hotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary where Queen Latifah had her culinary vacation in ""Last Holiday."" That gives me another opportunity to display my expertise on the Czech Republic by informing you that ""Pupp"" is pronounced ""poop,"" so no wonder it's the Splendid.
I never thought I would see a Bond movie where I cared, actually cared, about the people. But I care about Bond, and about Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), even though I know that (here it comes) a Martini Vesper is shaken, not stirred. Vesper Lynd, however, is definitely stirring, as she was in Bertolucci's wonderful ""The Dreamers."" Sometimes shaken, too. Vesper and James have a shower scene that answers, at last, why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions.
A review should not be a list. So I should not enumerate all the scenes I liked. But I learn from IMDb that the special credit for the ""free running"" scenes of Sabastian Foucan refers to the sensational opening Madagascar foot chase in which Foucan practices parkour, or the ability to run at walls and angles and bounce off them to climb or change direction; Jackie Chan could do similar feats.
Which brings up another thing. Most of the chases and stunts in ""Casino Royale"" take place in something vaguely approximating real space and time. Of course I know they use doubles and deceptive camera angles and edits to cover impossibilities, but the point is: They try to make it look real. Recently, with the advent of portable cameras and computerized editing, action movies have substituted visual chaos for visual elegance.
I think the public is getting tired of action sequences that are created in post-production. I've been swamped with letters complaining about ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" One guy said, ""Why don't critics admit they're tired of it?"" Actually, we're tired of writing about how tired of it we are.
The plot centers on a marathon high-stakes poker game, in which Bond will try to deprive Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) of 10 million or more pounds that would go to finance terrorism. Le Chiffre (""The Cypher"") has problems on his own, because he owes money big-time to the people who supply it to him. Director Martin Campbell builds suspense in the extended poker game by not being afraid to focus for long seconds on the eyes of the two main opponents, which is all the more effective because Le Chiffre's left eye has tears of blood, inspiring a classic Bond line. Bond's absences from the table are of more than ordinary interest.
This is Campbell's second Bond picture, after ""Goldeneye"" (1995), but he breaks with his own and everyone else's tradition. He's helped by Craig, who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong. To a certain degree, the earlier Bonds were lustful technicians. With this one, since he has a big scene involving a merchant's house in Venice, we can excuse ourselves for observing that if you prick him, he bleeds.",SPM_Doc5_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Positive,Casino_Royale
115,SPM_Doc6_CasinoRoyale,"What is it that you love about the Bond films? The music? The gadgets? The fascinating women? The utter charm and savoir-faire of Mr. Bond? The exotic locales? The ""eccentric"" cast of characters? Well, you better go see another movie to get these because you won't find them in this film.

The gadgets in this film seem to revolve around resuscitation, which, all things considered, was a good choice.

As far as fascinating women all I can say is Thank God for Judi Dench. She is hands down the most fascinating woman in this film. Eva Green, the Bond Girl in the film, is easy enough on the eyes, but there is nothing special about her. She lacks grace and seems to be putting inordinate effort in making sure her voice sounds ""low"", but she only succeeds in sounding funny. The good news is that at least she wasn't portraying a woman trying to behave like a man.

Now for the character of James Bond....in this rendition he is rude, crude, completely devoid of charm and acts as if he has no experience in the worldly, sophisticated ways of the world (and doesn't care if he does). We are used to a James Bond that is the epitome of ""cool under fire"", but this one is a cry baby. Another words, he is no different than so many of the clueless young men that lack manners in this world that you can run into on any given day. Why should I pay good money to see more of this?

The locales in this movie are O.K. Venice certainly is a beautiful place, but hardly what I would call ""exotic"" or unseen by the vast majority of people that will see this film. Ditto for The Bahamas. Boring. The Czech Republic was an interesting choice and certainly different so I will thank them for that.

As far as memory serves me, there was really only one ""eccentric"" in this film. No one else comes to mind, which should tell you something about the cast of characters for this movie.

Save your money and watch this film when it shows up on T.V.",SPM_Doc6_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Negative,Casino_Royale
116,SPM_Doc7_CasinoRoyale,"I've watched all the James Bond flicks from Connery to Brosnan and if there's one characteristic of all of them, it's formula. From the opening credits to the tech wizardry to the beautiful women to the action sequences, they all have to be there. Unlike other films where formulas are shunned, the Bond films thrive on formulas; which is why people keep coming back for more.

I had a feeling that the formulas that made all the other Bond films work had to be changed in order to justify the selection of Daniel Craig as a ""different"" Bond, which really doesn't make sense because you don't fix a franchise that ain't broke.

For instance, the gratuitous violence (for a Bond film) just can't be justified. Yes, the other Bonds killed people, but they managed to do it smoothly. There was no need for James Bond to get his suit wrinkled and stained and his hair all out of place in order to kill. It was unrealistic, but who said Bond was real? People loved Bond that way, and it worked.

True, the film had some entertainment value, but I felt that it was too long. The action scenes were just too repetitive. The gambling scenes overly stretched. I think that it would have been better with maybe 30% of the film left on the cutting room floor. In fact, my wife even slept midway through one of the action sequences.

As to the new Bond, he just seems, well, out of place. Again, I suppose the reason is really simple: Craig is not formulaic. He's not as smooth as the Bonds of the past. I don't even get why he mumbles his words. If the mumbling is intended, it absolutely doesn't work. I thought that Bond was an orphan, raised by the powers that be to be both a lethal killer and well-skilled in social graces.

All in all, I would say that this Bond doesn't work because it tries too bloody hard to work. It's the same as a golf swing. You change the mechanics of your backswing and you realize that you change the rest of your swing as well just to compensate.

Casino Royale is simply just a double bogey in my book.",SPM_Doc7_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Negative,Casino_Royale
117,SPM_Doc8_CasinoRoyale,"The late Desmond Llewellyn would have been pleased. As Q, the gadget man, he was always telling 007 to grow up. With the arrival of Daniel Craig, the sixth actor to play Bond in the world's most successful movie franchise, he gets his wish.

James is reborn in Casino Royale, and so is the series. It's the best Bond film for 10 years, and one of the best. It dispenses with many of the childish gimmicks we have grown used to, in favour of a more complex and character-driven story.

Bond is not the same man at the end as he is at the beginning. That's an enormous change, if you think about it. Bond has always been immutable, no matter who was playing him. The empire may have crumbled, the vandals may have taken over the world, but Bond always represented Ian Fleming's youthful ideal of the masculine virtues - a ruthless gentleman with impeccable taste and no emotions, the perfect spy and the perfect Englishman. A little bit Bulldog Drummond, a little bit Richard Hannay, from The 39 Steps. Craig's Bond has all of that ruthlessness, and more sex appeal than any Bond since Sean Connery, but he is a wounded animal by the end, broken by love. Who'd have thought it?

Fleming wrote Casino Royale in 1953, in a rush of nervous energy brought on (he said) by terror at his impending marriage to Ann Rothermere, who was carrying his child. It was the first James Bond novel and the first to be filmed (adapted for television in 1954), but it was also the book that got away. ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Albert Saltzman could never get their hands on it, because the rights were sold before they became the godfathers of the movie series. It was eventually done by another producer in 1967 as a big-budget spoof, in which Bond was played by three actors - Peter Sellers, David Niven and Woody Allen!

The rights were resolved in a series of court cases and swaps in the late 1990s. The result is that the 21st ""official"" Bond movie is distributed by Columbia Pictures, a subsidiary of Sony, rather than by MGM. The practical impact is that Bond now uses a Sony computer and phone, each displayed without subtlety, but these are unimportant, if irritating, commercial considerations. The bigger change is that the producers can go back to Fleming's earliest descriptions of Bond. With a new actor, they have seized the opportunity to begin again and that decision is liberating.

Many of the familiar tropes of a Bond movie are missing, or reduced.There are few gadgets and no scenes involving Q. There's no Smersh or Spectre or grand scheme for worldwide takeover, and no plan to steal a bomb or set up a laser weapon in space. There's no Cold War, which Judi Dench laments, in her fifth appearance as M - the head of MI6. Bond is not even a ""double 0"". He has not yet earned a licence to kill.

The way he does that in the first scene shows us how the approach has changed. The prologue is set in Prague and filmed in black and white. Bond investigates an agent who has been stealing funds. The agent thinks he's safe because Bond is not a ""double 0"", but a flashback shows us a fight in a men's toilet which is more bloody and confronting than usual. Bond kills the man with his bare hands, then shoots the embezzler without remorse. Two kills earns him the double O. Both leave the viewer shaken and stirred.

This is a cruel Bond, which is closer to Ian Fleming's original. He's arrogant, with fewer polished edges. After a mission in Africa ends badly, with Bond caught on camera killing an ostensibly unarmed man, M tells him he's a liability. ""Any thug can kill. I want you to take your ego out of the equation.""

Of course, Bond ignores her. The man he killed in Africa was working for a terrorist group. He follows the trail to the Bahamas, then Miami, then to a casino in Montenegro. An Albanian financier called Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) has lost $100 million of his terrorist clients' money. To win it back, he has set up a card game with a $10 million buy-in. Bond is sent to beat him, and make him talk to MI6. The Treasury sends along a beautiful accountant named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to keep an eye on the money.

This is close to Fleming's original plot, but the challenge is how to dramatise the book's centrepiece - an extended card game. The director, Martin Campbell, (whose last Bond film was Golden Eye, 11 years ago) does this brilliantly, through a gradual ratcheting of tension. This grows naturally as the stakes rise, but the long night of cards is interspersed with dramatic events away from the table. Bond kills twice and almost dies himself; his playful relationship with the comely Vesper turns serious. Events move in unexpected directions several times. It's a hell of a night, but not the sort we expect from a Bond movie. That's why the series is refreshed. They've thrown out the rule book.

There is still plenty of action, all of it superbly mounted. The opening chase scene in Africa, with Bond pursuing a suspect played by Sebastien Foucan, a French free-running champion, must be seen to be believed. And it is visibly credible, unlike the last Bond film, in which computer effects were used to depict things that weren't (such as an invisible car). This Bond film is more romantic, less fantastic, more tense, less silly, more dramatic, less comedic. Craig brings beef, biff and a slightly lonely dimension to the character. He's a fine actor and he has some of the working-class bile of the young Michael Caine. A new James Bond has certainly arrived.",SPM_Doc8_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Positive,Casino_Royale
118,SPM_Doc9_CasinoRoyale,"Martin Campbells Casino Royale, from a screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, based on the novel by Ian Fleming, happens to be the 21st James Bond movie, as well as the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery, from his (and the franchises) debut in 1962 with Dr. No, through From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and, after a one-picture hiatus, Diamonds Are Forever (1971).

Curiously, that single non-Connery hiatus Bond, 1969s On Her Majestys Secret Servicewith the much-underrated George Lazenby as 007 and the exquisite Diana Rigg as the Italian countess he loves, marries and mournsis actually my second-favorite entry in the series. Certainly Roger Moore was a comparatively lightweight Bond with his seven appearances in the series: Live and Let Die (1973), The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Moonraker (1979), For Your Eyes Only (1981), Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985).

Mr. Moore was succeeded, briefly, by Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylights (1987) and License to Kill (1989). Actually, Mr. Dalton came the closest to Mr. Craig in projecting stormy virility, and it was rumored that he did most of his own stunts. Still, Mr. Daltons vehicles were considered impediments to the flagging but still profitable property. Pierce Brosnan stepped into the breach with Goldeneye (1995), ably directed by Martin Campbell, who was to direct Casino Royale more than a decade later. Indeed, Mr. Brosnan was graced with unusually ambitious directors for his next (and last) three films in the franchise: Roger Spottiswoodes Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), Michael Apteds The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Lee Tamahoris Die Another Day (2002).

My recurring problem with Mr. Connerys Bond vis--vis Mr. Craigsadmittedly in retrospectis that, though Mr. Connery was the coolest and smoothest of all the Bonds, his coolness and smoothness would curdle over the course of a movie into a smug facetiousness. I must hasten to add that this wasnt true of most of his non-Bond roles.

Of course, Casino Royale has been adapted from Flemings first novel about 007, and so the character can profit from the vulnerability of a novice agent pitted against an ever more evil world. Bonds relationship with his superior, M (Judi Dench), in London gets off to a rocky start when he blows up an African embassy in Madagascar after a spectacular pursuit of an agile bomb-dealer named Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan). The joke is that the whole city seems to be under construction, enabling Bond and Mollaka to exploit every unfinished construction site and skeletal edifice in their chase. The grim-faced Mr. Craig has already been introduced as a deadpan killer with a sense of humor about his comparatively new vocation, but it is a dry-as-dust humor that he purveys. I must confess that at first I couldnt tell him apart from the villains in the crowd scenesand this is good for a supposed undercover agent. As he flits about with seeming effortlessness from Madagascar to the Bahamas to Montenegro to Venice for the movies watery climaxpart of the franchises formulahe never loses control of a character who manages to be stoical and feverish at one and the same time. Even when he is poisoned to within a heartbeat of death, and then later tortured in the most imaginatively painful way, some irreducible part of Mr. Craigs Bond remains on the alert.

The poisoning occurs during a titanically high-stakes poker game in a Montenegrin gambling casinoa sequence that seems unusually prolonged, possibly to justify the title of the film and its opening playing-card credits. (There are spoilers to follow, so readers of tender sensibility should avert their eyes here.) After the high suspense created by visual cues attesting to the hypnotic power of kings and jacks, Bond finally wins his showdown with the arch villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), with a low-black-card straight flush beating Le Chiffres high-card full house. It helps that Le Chiffre is afflicted with an ocular problem that causes him to shed tears of blood; it also helps the film that Mr. Mikkelsen is slightly better looking than Mr. Craig, making the battle between good and evil onscreen visually more complex.

From her first briefing of 007, M makes it crystal clear that no ideological issues are involved in Bonds hunt for arms merchants in the bomb trade; the only motive for Le Chiffre, his cohorts and even his enemies is money. This disclaimer neatly severs Casino Royale from the never-ending war on terror, both here and in Britain, which may be a good thing for the filmBond is thereby released from getting an uncharacteristically patriotic gleam in his eye as he disposes of his antagonists.

What distinguishes Mr. Craigs Bond from all the others, except Mr. Lazenbys, is his expression of both passion and grief after winning and losing Eva Greens Vesper Lynd, who seems for a time to have betrayed himthough, as it turns out, she has saved his life, not once but twice. The relationship begins on the comically sarcastic note that always bodes well for any movie relationship. Vesper displays a flair for the veiled insult, and Bond responds with a faintly amused curiosity. But he has been chastened by a previous affair that has gone badly for the married woman he recklessly bedded. The world he lives in is too dangerous for him to lightly contemplate another romantic adventure, but the rush of violent circumstances drive Vesper and Bond into each others arms, where they remain until their prior alliances rise up to engulf them. That Bond so convincingly retains his composure and sang-froid throughout all the horrors that ensue is a testament to Mr. Craigs abilities as an actor, and to Mr. Campbells astuteness as a director.

People might think that my guiding mantra for Casino Royale and On Her Majestys Secret Service (and most other movies as well) happens to be cherchez la femme. But change that to aimez la femme and Id plead pleasurably guilty, even as I wholeheartedly recommend Casino Royale as one of the best pictures of the yearnot that it will need much help at the box office.",SPM_Doc9_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Positive,Casino_Royale
119,SPM_Doc10_CasinoRoyale,"Anyone who has followed the James Bond series even casually over the years knows that there have been serviceable Bonds (Roger Moore), blas Bonds (George Lazenby) and vaguely unobjectionable Bonds (Pierce Brosnan). But if the greatest Bond is still Sean Connery -- his chipped-ice elegance so clearly defined the franchise that there's no replacing him -- then Daniel Craig is the first Botticelli Bond.

In Martin Campbell's blissfully entertaining ""Casino Royale,"" the 21st picture in the 007 franchise, Craig is Bond reinvented and reborn, a creature so unexpectedly distinctive that even though we all think we know what we want in a Bond, we could never have dreamed this one up. He's not what we think of as the classic Bond type: His body isn't a tuxedo-ready balanced equation but a wedge of muscle that demands clever tailoring. His profile, with its coulda been a contender nose, is so strong and beautiful it wouldn't be out of place on a Greek amphora -- yet his ears, jutting out with boyish awkwardness, look more like the handles. But his charisma both overrides and enhances any physical attributes. Emerging from the sea after a swim with his lady love, he's a scrappy blond god in tiny blue swim shorts; the moment is a clear visual nod to Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No,"" but also an unwitting reference to Venus on the half shell. This is Bond as we've never seen him, more naked, alive and mysterious than ever.

""Casino Royale"" is almost everything you want in a Bond movie, as well as everything you didn't know you wanted. Campbell has directed one other Bond picture, the 1995 ""GoldenEye."" But ""Casino Royale,"" at least in terms of its action sequences, takes more of its cues from Campbell's two terrific Saturday-afternoon swashbucklers, ""The Mask of Zorro"" and ""The Legend of Zorro."" Over the past 20 years or so, the Bond movies have become increasingly encumbered by big explosions and noisy effects, at the expense of clever stunts and, often, wit. But Campbell brings to ""Casino Royale"" a clear love and respect for pure action: There are a few explosions here and there, but the action sequences really dominate. And if this is one of the darkest Bond movies ever made -- we're meeting Bond near the beginning of his career, just after he's been promoted to double-0 status, and he's clearly having trouble putting his thuggish instincts to use in international espionage -- it's also one of the funniest. (This is a Bond picture in which 007 can joke about chocolate, as well as martinis.) The picture's violence is at times brutal, but it always has the appropriate weight: It's neither frivolous nor excessively heavy-spirited.

""Casino Royale"" opens with a major cockup on Bond's part: The freshly minted double-0, undercover in Madagascar, goes after, and kills, an ace bomb maker named Mollaka, even though he's been instructed to keep the man alive. (Mollaka is played by Sbastien Foucan, one of the inventors of Parkour, or ""free-running,"" a style of moving at top speeds -- on foot -- that involves bouncing off obstacles and barriers. The chase scene between Mollaka and Bond takes place at a construction site that's conveniently littered with myriad obstacles and barriers, and it's exhilarating to watch. It also features a great deal of rare and refreshing hand-to-hand combat, as opposed to the usual gunplay.)

Bond's supervisor, the imperious mite M (once again played by the marvelously intimidating Judi Dench), greatly displeased with the man she's just promoted, warns him that he'll need to cool his hotheadedness, prefacing her lecture with the words, ""This may be too much for a blunt instrument to understand."" This Bond is a blunt instrument, a bruiser who's not afraid of getting bruised, so ready to act that he doesn't always think before doing so. And so M cautiously sends him off on his mission, which involves sleek metal suitcases stuffed with money, deadly international terrorists and a creepy, clammy villain, le Chiffre (played by the Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen), who, because of a malfunctioning tear duct, cries tears of blood like a miracle Virgin. He also plays a mean game of Texas Hold 'em.

Much of the out-and-out action in ""Casino Royale"" -- the sharply paced chases and shootouts -- takes place in the first two-thirds of the picture, which is rarely dull, even for an instant. (The cinematographer, Phil Mheux, shoots the action, and the exotic locales, with brisk clarity.) Even so, the movie clicks into high gear -- and subtly sharpens its focus -- when Bond puts on a tuxedo for the first time. In the early part of ""Casino Royale,"" this greenhorn Bond wears serviceable undercover clothes, comfortable but unremarkable trousers and short-sleeved shirts that stretch -- barely -- over his considerable biceps. But when it comes time to meet his nemesis across the card table at the casino (supposedly located in Montenegro, although this part of the movie was filmed in a spa town in the Czech Republic), the tuxedo he puts on isn't the one he's brought with him: It has been chosen for him by a woman he's just met, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a reluctant assistant on his mission. Vesper is the government beauty who's been called in to keep an eye on the money that Bond will be using at the card tables, which, of course, belongs to Bond's employer, the Crown. Vesper has to pose as Bond's girlfriend, a task that displeases her greatly, since she's already been turned off by his arrogance. When he protests that he has his own tuxedo, and then notes that the new one has already been tailored to his exact measurements, Vesper remarks that she sized him up on their first meeting -- in all ways, she's already taken his measure.

Green -- first seen in Bernardo Bertolucci's sorely underrated ""The Dreamers"" -- and Craig are a glorious pairing; their scenes together have the best kind of romantic-comedy crackle. Vesper -- Bond has a great time teasing her about her name -- is one of the few Bond Girls to have a well-defined character, a template that gives her plenty of shadow and light to work with. (The writers here, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, working with Paul Haggis, have done right by all the major characters.) Green, with her bisque complexion and midnight hair, is obviously stunning to look at, but she also brings shades of cool gravity and vulnerability to her character that feel wholly natural. She stands up, in 4-inch heels, to this very potent Bond, matching him step-for-step.

That's essential, because this Bond is unlike any other we've seen. The character of James Bond is universally thought of as a sex symbol. But that's different from actually being sexy, and none of the movie Bonds -- not even Connery, as suavely likable as he is -- have really been about sex. They've mostly been about getting it, over and over again. (The franchise's idea of great sex has more to do with quantity than with quality.)

But Craig changes all that. He's the first truly erotic James Bond, a creature whose impulses and desires are alternately predictable and unreadable. This has very little to do with Craig's buffed-up build (those miniature swim trunks notwithstanding) and nearly everything to do with his face: His smile is wary, as if it had been repurposed from a scowl; his wildflower-blue eyes betray nothing and tell us everything. Craig, an actor who has been superb in a broad range of roles, in pictures as disparate as ""The Mother,"" ""Munich"" and ""Sylvia,"" here plays a stereotype, the iconic masculine hero with hidden vulnerabilities. But he's a stereotype with wings: There's no holding him down or boxing him in.

All Bond movies have some sort of cartoonish lovemaking in them. But actual love scenes are harder to come by in Bond movies, and ""Casino Royale"" -- which in some ways resembles another wonderful Bond picture, one with unusual emotional depth, the 1969 ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" -- features a great one. To describe it is to spoil it, but I will say that it's a clever and lovely antidote to the ubiquitous dumb, uncomfortable-looking shower-sex scene. Bond and Vesper are fully clothed in this sequence; the erotic charge between them is subtle but intense. The delicacy of this brief moment between them is just one of the things that sets ""Casino Royale"" apart from all other action movies, and even apart from many of the previous Bond movies. This, at last, is Bond stripped bare.",SPM_Doc10_CasinoRoyale,SPM,Action,Positive,Casino_Royale
120,SMM_Doc1_RedNotice,"Three of the biggest movie stars in the world converge for one big action-adventure spectacular, enlivened by (reported) $20 million paychecks and the rare thrill of playing around with fellow titans. That setup makes the new film Red Notice (Netflix, November 12) sound like some project from the late 1990s, before IP became the selling point and actors more incidental. But it is indeed a film from and for the here and now. In that, Red Notice serves as a reminder that, well, they just don’t make them like they used to. The stars in question are Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds, and Gal Gadot, all actors from the franchise world. The experiment of Rawson Marshall Thurber’s film is to see if their respective styles can meld together into something that may kick off yet another franchise. It’s an experiment that Netflix reportedly spent $200 million to run. Alas, Red Notice is limp and dull, and does more to showcase the shortcomings of each of its marquee idols than it does to highlight their bankable charisma. A globe-trotting heist film that heavily relies on zippy banter, Red Notice never finds its groove, instead jerking around between familiar action sequences and humor that never lands. Johnson plays FBI profiler John Hartley, who’s tasked with preventing the theft of a priceless golden egg made by Marc Antony for his doomed love, Cleopatra. Hartley fails when the world’s greatest art thief, Reynolds’s Nolan Booth, absconds with the thing. There’s another, perhaps better thief in the mix as well: Gadot’s The Bishop. And, as it turns out, there are a total of three missing eggs that need collecting. These objects don’t have any magical, Ark of the Covenant-esque properties, but the Indiana Jones movies are nonetheless referenced in Red Notice, both in a Nazi-loot plotline and by Reynolds whistling a bit of John Williams’s theme music. Red Notice would be better off not reminding us of far better things. It’s fitting that Reynolds should be the one to do the referencing—as his character nods to lots of other old things, like Pulp Fiction and the way Borat says ""nice."" These irksome little non-jokes (Remember that thing??) aptly represent Reynolds’s grating performance, a schtick that’s seriously diminished in charm since Reynolds first trotted it out over 20 years ago. It feels lazy, like Reynolds is coasting on his Deadpool clout. Johnson, once again playing the swaggering but gentle hulk, fares a bit better, because he is generally a more winsome performer. But there’s still a halfhearted drag to his work here. Nothing in Marshall Thurber’s script helps Johnson, or anyone else, rise to the occasion. Gadot mostly just has to slink and sass and be smarter than the boys, doing a more wicked, but empty, riff on Diana Prince’s cool proficiency. She has discernible chemistry with neither Johnson nor Reynolds, who also have none with each another. Yet the movie is constantly telegraphing that we’re watching two icons bouncing off of one another, with surely dazzling results. Red Notice makes no effort to distinguish the characters that the actors are playing; it merely says, Look! They’re in the same movie! The film’s grim insistence that we are witnessing some seismic movie star coming-together makes one fret, a little, about the future of film iconography. Then again, available right now on Netflix (and, according to some early viewer data, playing like gangbusters there) is the gloriously invigorating Western The Harder They Fall. That film is loaded with starry swagger, its various heists and showdowns given effervescence by an ensemble of terrific, name-brand actors. Sure, that cast can’t quite match the collective box office numbers of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot. But maybe they should be given the chance to try—while the members of the $20 million club go learn some badly needed new tricks.",SMM_Doc1_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Negative,Red_Notice
121,SMM_Doc2_RedNotice,"Once upon a time in Hollywood: People realized that people in movies would make people go to the movies. Not just anybody — certain people. People who had that thing, that indescribable quality that made film cameras love them and audiences love them even more. They settled on calling them movie stars, suggesting something that would burn blindingly bright then either flame out or fade to black. When you were lucky enough to get a Clara or a Chaplin, a Marilyn or a Marlon, a Clooney and a Julia, you knew what you were getting. Some of them were versatile actors; for others, the concept of “range” barely even mattered. Maybe they were playing a starlet, or a blind surgeon, or a cop who has to make a choice, or a migrant farm worker who sees the face of God in a potato. It did not matter. You went to see them, or rather “them,” a screen persona blown up to IMAX-sized proportions. Then a funny thing happened. (Gather round, children, Grandpa is telling a story.) Movie stars became something closer to comets, arcing through the sky with an increasing rarity. Some still roamed the red-carpeted Earth, gracing magazine covers [cough, cough] and fulfilling our needs for archetypes. By the 21st century, however, it was becoming harder to sell and sustain the whole shebang. Two terrible, horrible, no-good, very-bad opening weekends, and sayonara. Even “all-star” projects began to feel a little threadbare: Only a third of the Ocean’s Eleven crew technically qualify as being above-the-title names. And the few that occupied that second tier of the A-list migrated to television. Now, intellectual properties — there was something you could count on! You could sell tickets to those types of movies everywhere. You could replace actors who were difficult to handle, because whoever was behind the mask didn’t matter as much as the mask itself. You might even use them to mint something close to a star by proxy. Most people might not have known who Chris Evans was a decade ago. But they can tell you who played Captain America now. Should you love movies and still cling to the wobbly notion that stardom is part of the package, it’s tempting to wonder who they would have cast in Red Notice during different eras. Trust us: You will need a fun distraction to get through this threadbare, throwback attempt at a celebrity-driven caper. There’s a world in which Burt Lancaster is the FBI’s top criminal profiler, Jerry Lewis is an internationally wanted jewel thief and Audrey Hepburn is a mysterious femme fatale known as “Bishop.” Or close your eyes, and drop Sylvester Stallone, John Belushi and Faye Dunaway into those roles, all of them chasing each other around the world over three priceless golden eggs that once belonged to Cleopatra. How about making Clint Eastwood, Eddie Murphy and Demi Moore jump out of stained-glass windows, engage in high-speed chases and lounge around on yachts? Really, the idea behind this lazy blockbuster-by-numbers is that you could throw any three famous people into some wonky, generic mash-up of Bond thrillers, buddy comedies, heist flicks, and Raiders of the Lost Ark outtakes and you’d still get the same diminishing returns. (We also realize there are worst-case scenarios here as well, and while we can forgive, we must never forget.) There are extremely slim pickings for a 2021 iteration of this, which is why you get One of the Last Genuine Movie Stars Standing (Dwayne Johnson), a Very Handsome Smart-ass Who Can Also Open a Film (Ryan Reynolds) and an International Sensation Who Kicks Ass in Evening Gowns (Gal Gadot) globetrotting between Bali and Rome and Cairo, trading “quips” and looking great in expensive casual wear and doing everything but wink at the audience. The fact that two of them became mega-famous thanks to comic-book franchises — and the third is about to join the DC Universe, though years of pro-wrestling and a key part in the Fast & Furious flicks basically meant Johnson was doing superhero-movie duty already — gives you a good idea of how the system works now. Honestly, we applaud the restraint Netflix showed by not slapping the tagline “Deadpool and Wonder Woman Drive Hobbs Bananas!” on this and selling it that way. In the past, this might have been a huge summer tentpole movie, given the sort of Planet-Hollywood-photo-shoot-writ-large premiere that suggested gods still walked among us. Now, it’s merely more Content™, something to stream between finishing that dystopian South Korean satire and starting a new season of The Great British Baking Show. Everyone involved seems to understand that this is how Red Notice — which stands for Interpol’s highest most-wanted classification, a fact that now seems ironic given the quality of the product at hand — will be consumed. So, y’know, just show up and do your thing, guys, and give the people on the couch what you think they want from you. Dwayne, you’re a compelling screen performer, so in between rehashing action scenes from better multiplex fodder, feel free to…simply stand there and look stern? Maybe give folks the side-eye occasionally? Ryan, dial up that ain’t-a-stinker act to 100, and lace every single line with weapons-grade snark. Gal, do whatever it is you do — tilt your head? look like you’re about to scold some kids? — when you’re not deflecting bullets with Amazonian bracelets. Don’t worry about plot points or WTF last-minute twists or why somebody is where or who these characters are or that this somehow all seems familiar but wrong in every possible way. Go be movie stars in exotic locales, but without all the fun that entails. Ok, what, we’re supposed to just lap all of this up and be thankful writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber can swoop a camera? (Having been granted a permanent hall pass for giving the world Dodgeball, this particular test of your tolerance for duck-shit-slick moviemaking suggests it’s time to revoke it.) There’s something incredibly deflating about all of this, from the waste of precious screen-talent resources to the sense that you’re watching the last gasp of an age-old formula. It is like staring at a bright, shiny epitaph for two hours. We may not be able to make magnificent movie stars by the dozens anymore. But we can sure as heck make better movie-star movies than this.",SMM_Doc2_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Negative,Red_Notice
122,SMM_Doc3_RedNotice,"If you assembled a focus group of frequent moviegoers and asked them to describe the elements of a good action film, they’d probably come up with something along the lines of Red Notice. The star-laden blockbuster, which is dropping on Netflix this week, features three A-list names, all in familiar roles: Dwayne Johnson as a tough FBI agent, Ryan Reynolds as a motormouthed art thief, and Gal Gadot as a mysterious criminal who forces the two men to team up against her. The work is complete with globe-trotting set pieces, self-aware jokes delivered straight to the camera, and constantly shifting loyalties as each character tries to stay ahead of the others on the quest for some glittery MacGuffin. Everything about Red Notice seems almost algorithmically determined, from the cast to the familiar tropes, so the association with Netflix, a company that prides itself on blending art and machine learning (at least in its recommendations), comes as no surprise. But this film was sought after by practically every major studio before a script even existed, based on its plot description and Johnson’s involvement alone. Netflix only later acquired the work, which was written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. I went into my screening wondering what about that original pitch was scintillating enough to spark such a frenzied bidding war—did it offer some fresh take on the action film, for example? What I saw disappointed me: Red Notice is a glossy but empty product that indicates the extent of the genre’s current crisis. That might seem like a dramatic pronouncement. Other types of movies, such as adult dramas and comedies, have started to vanish from big screens, but every week box offices are seemingly choked with blockbuster brawls. The genre has become essentially every studio’s economic powerhouse, resulting in uninspired predictability and heroes who are never actually in danger; the trashy artistry of 1980s and ’90s action classics is nothing more than a distant memory. Now many of the movies are tied to the same existing franchises (like James Bond or The Fast and the Furious), comic books, or video games. Johnson is one of the few stars who actually gets expensive, original action films made, but of late he’s tended toward disappointingly safe material. Red Notice is his most generic effort yet. In it, Johnson plays John Hartley, an FBI agent tasked with catching the notorious art thief Nolan Booth (Reynolds). Booth is on the tail of three priceless golden eggs that were supposedly once owned by Cleopatra, but so is another bandit called the Bishop (Gadot). Hartley and Booth end up hunting around the world together, the former trying to bring the Bishop to justice, the latter looking for the treasure she’s seeking. The two dash through expensive-looking sequences set in glitzy museums, a bullfighting ring, and the deep South American jungle. They double-cross each other a few times along the way, but these betrayals only flimsily channel the oppositional buddy energy that helped drive classics such as 48 Hrs., Lethal Weapon, or Midnight Run back in the genre’s heyday. Nothing is inherently wrong with familiarity. Hollywood has always recycled formulas that audiences respond to, and a different version of Red Notice might have had a little more verve. But its three stars seem uninterested in fleshing out their performances beyond the bare minimum. Johnson’s Hartley isn’t so much a character as he is a collection of competent skills wrapped up in a muscular package; his only flaw appears to be that he works too hard. Reynolds stays in his usual territory, with a character who is almost identical to his best-known role as the wisecracking Deadpool—Booth references popular movies, deflates tension with snarky jokes, and fills dead air with winking bloviation. Gadot has by far the least screen time, and she uses it to do absolutely nothing of interest. The entire project seems designed to keep the stars within their comfort zones. I once described another Netflix film, the perfectly enjoyable Adam Sandler comedy Murder Mystery, as “background cinema.” Red Notice is the (reportedly) $200 million version of that. You can put it on the TV while you browse the internet on your phone, look up once in a while, and get the gist. Have you ever seen Dwayne Johnson throw someone across a room, or Ryan Reynolds snappily bicker before? Then why even look at the TV this time? It’s only more of the same. I’m sure Red Notice would play better on a big screen—basically any movie would—but imposing visuals, a booming sound system, and the inability to look at your phone still wouldn’t solve the film’s most fundamental issues. The story lacks tension, because while its premise depends on conflict among the three stars, all of them are hyper-professional masterminds who can extricate themselves out of any situation smoothly. They’re never in any true danger, and they don’t seem likely to undergo a permanent change or arrive at a major self-realization. When punches land in this film, they leave no bruise; when bullets hit, no blood gets spilled. I don’t necessarily expect realism from my action movies, but if everyone’s walking out of a scene unscathed, it’s hard to know why I should pay attention to the next one.",SMM_Doc3_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Negative,Red_Notice
123,SMM_Doc4_RedNotice,"The high-octane heist thriller “Red Notice” is reportedly the most expensive movie in the history of Netflix, with a budget somewhere in the $160 million neighborhood — and it certainly looks the part, with three major stars sharing top billing and all sorts of swooping camera angles capturing a number of high-production-level action sequences involving prison escapes and helicopter hijinks and elaborate chases and all that jazz. Problem is, there’s no movie inside this movie. It’s a breezy and intermittently entertaining and super slick work, but it’s filled with so many overly familiar notes and well-worn cliches, and there are so many winking nods to the viewer, it feels as if we’re about two rewrites away from this thing being a flat-out spoof on the level of “Airplane!” or “Hot Shots!” or “Scary Movie.” Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds are among the most charismatic stars in the world, but they collectively almost neglect to give legitimate performances here, as they’re so committed to playing off their own images, to the point where we half-expect them to take a pause halfway through the story so Johnson can demonstrate one of his badass workout routines, Reynolds can make a funny joke about his fake feud with Hugh Jackman and Gadot can start another sing-along a la her infamous “Imagine” celebrity medley. (As it is, there’s a gratuitous in-joke about Johnson’s fast-and-furious rival Vin Diesel.) In fact, Gadot’s character, who is known as The Bishop, does sing an iconic pop standard from a half-century ago, delivering a rendition of “Downtown,” and that makes it two straight weeks for a cappella takes on that Petula Clark standard, and I much preferred the Anya Taylor-Joy version in “Last Night in Soho.” Here, Gadot sings “Downtown” while administering jumper-cable shock torture to a character’s testicles. She’s going downtown, get it? That’s the level of sophisticated alleged humor on display in “Red Notice.” Ah, but let’s go back to the beginning, with the obligatory origins story setting up the convoluted and increasingly ridiculous storyline, which is so over the top they could have gone to animation in the final scenes. It’s all about “The Mystery of Cleopatra’s Third Egg,” and no, it’s not some time-traveling fertilization story. According to the lore, Mark Antony pledged his love to Cleopatra by presenting her with three bejeweled eggs, “each one more exquisite than the last,” as we’re told in voice-over. For centuries, these treasured eggs were lost to history, but two of the eggs were discovered in the early 20th century, and in present day, one egg is in a museum in Rome, one belongs to a private collector, and the third — well, that will be revealed in due time, my friend. Dwayne Johnson is the FBI’s top forensic profiler, one John Hartley, who arrives at the aforementioned Italian museum with Rita Arya’s Interpol Inspector Urvashi Das, as they’ve been tipped off that the world-famous thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) is planning to steal one of Cleopatra’s eggs that very day. “Your badge is no good here,” says Inspector Das, “so no American cowboy stuff.” “Don’t worry, I left my chaps at home,” comes the retort, and away we go. Sure enough, Booth has the egg, and as he dashes away, Inspector Das exclaims to her troops, “He’s heading for the exit!” GOOD GUESS. After an elongated sequence featuring construction scaffolding straight out of a Rube Goldberg cartoon, snappy banter between Booth and Hartley in which Booth comments on Hartley’s snazzy leather jacket and his giant bald head, some CGI background stuff that has both Booth and Hartley hanging from the edge of a building before plummeting down to the usual convenient awning — oh and let’s not forget some painfully obvious product placement for Coca-Cola and Porsche — Booth manages to escape, and soon Inspector Das is led to believe Hartley isn’t even with the FBI and in fact he’s the real thief here. Eventually both Hartley and Booth are confined in a Russian gulag, where Booth keeps commenting on their budding friendship and Hartley keeps saying they are not friends, even though they share twin “my father was terrible” stories. Along the way, we meet Gal Gadot’s The Bishop, who is the world’s greatest thief (Booth is No. 2) and is using Hartley and Booth as pawns, get it, as she masterminds a long con designed to take possession of all three eggs. That plan involves a narcissistic arms dealer named Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos), who is forever taking off his shirt to reveal his tattooed torso and talks in an exaggerated whisper as if he’s in a James Bond spoof film and who happens to own the second egg, at least for now. Sotto Voce thinks The Bishop is in love with him, which makes him yet another sucker in her game. “Red Notice” takes one twist and turn after another, none of them particularly clever, as the dialogue is filled with references to movies such as “Sullivan’s Travels,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Jurassic Park,” which only serve to remind us we’d rather be watching “Sullivan’s Travels,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark” or “Jurassic Park.” Thanks for the notice.",SMM_Doc4_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Negative,Red_Notice
124,SMM_Doc5_RedNotice,"A red notice, as helpfully defined by “Red Notice,” is the highest level of arrest warrant issued by Interpol. You might think of this detail as a red herring, given how little it really factors into the movie’s cheerfully hectic heist-caper plot. The title color, however, does get quite a workout: It pops up in the brilliant red gown Gal Gadot wears to a masquerade ball and in the red-ringed arena where Dwayne Johnson stares down a raging bull. And of course, it appears in the bright red Netflix logo that proudly kicks off the movie — the kind of noisily globe-trotting, tomb-raiding, rocket-launching entertainment that, a few years ago, would have been released by a traditional studio. That was actually the plan in 2018, when Universal Pictures greenlit “Red Notice” on the strength of Johnson’s attachment and presumably some hint of a premise (big guns, priceless artifacts, daddy issues — it writes itself). But a year later, before production began, the studio balked for widely speculated-about reasons: Maybe they finally took a look at writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s script, or maybe they were scared off by the (undeserved!) box office disappointment of “Skyscraper,” the previous Thurber-Johnson joint. Whatever the cause, Netflix snapped up the picture for more than $160 million, making it one of the costliest movies in the streamer’s history and dropping more than a few industry jaws. That was all before the pandemic, which delayed the movie’s production and normalized the once-unthinkable prospect of pricey studio movies (like, say, Gadot’s “Wonder Woman 1984”) becoming predominantly streaming experiences. All of which makes the tediously cranked-up “Red Notice” only slightly more interesting as a movie-industry story involving enormous quantities of money than it is as a fictional story involving enormous quantities of money. One hundred sixty million dollars is a hefty sum (and probably a conservative estimate), but it’s dwarfed by the $300 million payday being chased by this movie’s trio of disreputables. Johnson plays John Hartley, an FBI profiler who’s set his sights on Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), one of the world’s most wanted and obnoxiously deadpan art thieves. Soon they’re embroiled in a scheme centered on three bejeweled eggs once owned by Cleopatra, all of them now kept under lock and key in far-flung corners of the globe. Various sub-Dan Brown, sub-James Bond, sub-Indiana Jones shenanigans ensue: Windows shatter, scaffolding collapses and a brand spankin’ new Porsche lasts about five seconds into a not-so-thrilling chase in one of the movie’s better gags. The action leaps from a museum in Rome to a getaway in Bali to a prison in coldest Russia, which is where the no-nonsense agent and the wily thief go from reluctant cellmates to reluctant partners. Forcing their hand with a mischievous wink is Booth’s archrival in crime, the Bishop (Gadot), who has an annoying talent for playing Booth and Hartley off each other while remaining several steps merrily ahead. This forced triangulation adds a too-faint crackle of sexual tension and a whole lot of lopsided banter, with Reynolds predictably dominating the wisecracks while his co-stars have the general good sense not to even try keeping up. The miscast Gadot finds herself at a particular disadvantage. Whether she’s mocking a trussed-up intelligence analyst or applying electroshock paddles to Johnson’s nether-regions, she confirms — much as her luminously earnest Wonder Woman performances already suggested — that winking cynicism isn’t her strong suit. Johnson, a deft performer with a gift for self-mockery, fares somewhat better. As in Thurber’s delightfully dumb-but-not-so-dumb “Central Intelligence,” he finds himself cast as the bigger, buffer side in a rambunctious action-comedy bromance; in that movie, however, he and Kevin Hart both played against type and struck on a surprisingly fresh, counterintuitive dynamic. Johnson and Reynolds aren’t the worst action duo — they’re both good at dangling from roof railings — but their odd-couple bit is thin and predictable by comparison. Reynolds basically sits there shooting off his mouth, rattling off up-to-the-minute references to Instagram and Post Malone, while Johnson responds with mostly stony silence, his facial muscles occasionally stretching the short distance from exasperated to unimpressed. Put another way: Reynolds is there to mock and deconstruct the plot (“Look for a box that says ‘MacGuffin,’” he notes during a particularly dull stretch of the egg hunt), while Johnson and Gadot are on hand to earnestly recap it. And some recapping is admittedly helpful, given how busily Thurber piles on the narrative fake-outs and tedious side characters, including an Interpol killjoy (Ritu Arya) and a shirtless arms dealer (Chris Diamantopoulos) — all en route to an ending so inane that the characters seem faintly embarrassed to have to go along with it. A depressing reminder of what Hollywood considers “original” material these days, “Red Notice” plays one of those self-consciously convoluted, ultimately derivative long cons that strain so hard to seem breezily insouciant they wind up wearing you out. By the end, it’s the clichés that warrant a rest.",SMM_Doc5_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Negative,Red_Notice
125,SMM_Doc6_RedNotice,"A buddy action-comedy that blends elements of James Bond, Mission: Impossible, Entrapment, Indiana Jones, True Lies, The Fugitive, and many, many more, Red Notice is a welcome throwback to the days before omnipresent franchises and IP, when movie stars and original (or, in this case, “original”) blockbusters ruled the industry. Of course, writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s spectacular isn’t—save for one limited week, beginning Nov. 5—arriving in multiplexes as its predecessors did; rather, it’s debuting on Netflix (Nov. 12) as the streaming platform’s most expensive endeavor to date, at a reported cost of upwards of $200 million. Nonetheless, there’s something refreshingly old school about this mega-budget project, which puts all of its money on the screen in one giant globetrotting set piece after another while hinging its success on the charisma of its sexy, bruising, funny leads. In the mid-’90s, Red Notice would have resembled any number of summer movies built around the appeal of marquee headliners and a slam-bang premise. Today, however, it feels practically anachronistic, and it’s refreshing to have a gaudily expensive production such as this strive to entertain through lots of frantic sizzle and witty one-liners, the last of which come via Ryan Reynolds, one-third of the film’s A-list trio that also includes Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Gal Gadot. There’s no depth here; only a well-worn text that’s been retrofitted with occasional CGI. As such, it’s the sort of venture they generally don’t make anymore, and the fact that it’s made pretty well immediately casts it as an antidote to the endless barrage of superhero, sci-fi, and horror sequels and retreads that now dominate the marketplace. Put another way: Red Notice is akin to a slightly higher class of junk food that you haven’t eaten in a while, and much of the satisfaction derived from its nonsense is due to the participation of Reynolds. As cocky master thief Nolan Booth, the Deadpool and Free Guy star does exactly what he always does, which is flash his pearly whites with a self-consciously arrogant twinkle in his eye and crack wise whenever possible. In Red Notice, that’s just about every time he opens his mouth; Thurber’s script imagines Booth as a limitless fount of snarky pop culture-inflected quips. Many of those remarks are funny in and of themselves (for example, after some Johnson clumsiness at a black-tie event, Reynolds exclaims, “You look like a well-dressed wall!”). Yet it’s the ceaselessness of his jokey barrage that’s truly winning; at a certain point, one simply winds up chuckling at Reynolds’ inexhaustible supply of silly jibes and retorts. If you don’t have a high tolerance for Reynolds’ schtick, Red Notice won’t win you over, since he’s the comedic third of a triptych in which Johnson serves as the straight-man muscle and Gadot functions as the sultry villainess. That structure isn’t very novel but it does allow each star to play to their strengths, and it results in a three-way dynamic that allows for creative mismatches, both in terms of banter and skirmishes. Reynolds and Johnson are a bickering little-big pair, Reynolds and Gadot share a competitive dueling-burglar rapport, and Johnson and Gadot have a flirtatious-adversary chemistry, all of which is exploited in a variety of different locales that keeps things fresh, be it an imposing Rome art museum, a wintry Russian prison, an opulent Valencia mansion, or the lush jungles of Argentina. You’ll notice that I’ve yet to discuss the actual plot of Red Notice, and that’s largely because it’s an amalgamation of many oft-told tales that’s just the pretext for seeing these actors strut their highly particular stuff. Thurber’s saga concerns three priceless bejeweled eggs that Mark Antony gave to Cleopatra, one of which has been lost to time. Booth covets them as a means of proving that he’s the greatest thief in the world, and so too does his rival, the Bishop (Gadot); John Hartley (Johnson), meanwhile, is the FBI profiler driven to stop them both from pulling off their robberies. As far as setups go, it’s relatively routine, although the film stages its daring heists, outrageous prison breaks, and treasure hunting with gusto, assuming various guises—a little Ghost Protocol here, a bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark there—with a verve that makes its conventionality go down smoother. There are double-crosses and surprises aplenty in Red Notice, some of them telegraphed more egregiously than others, and its well-executed fights and gags maintain a lively atmosphere that’s far more important than the preposterousness of its narrative twists and turns. Arms dealers, torture, SWAT teams, and rockets that miraculously pass through the doors of a flying helicopter are all part of its overstuffed and absurd stew. Thurber smartly leans into the inherent ridiculousness of his endeavor—as well as has Reynolds make a couple of overt cracks about it—without letting things tip into parody. That balancing act is matched by the performances of Johnson, Gadot, and Reynolds, who appear to be having a blast embodying characters that are less three-dimensional human beings than exaggerated riffs on their own distinctive big-screen personas. Red Notice embraces a typical banter-chase-banter-fight-banter-explosion formula, and its script is split evenly between Reynolds smart-assery and functional exposition, the latter of which sometimes turns out to be merely more of the former. It’s got the energy of an eager-to-please puppy dog, and a pedal-to-the-metal pace that helps it blow past most questionable plot developments. The film comes across as a combination of Thurber’s prior two Johnson collaborations (Central Intelligence and Skyscraper), and though he’s no great visual stylist, the writer/director handles his material’s numerous modes with proficiency, infusing his PG-13 violence with wit (and vice versa) in order to keep the proceedings light and amusing. They’re also lavish, even if a handful of scenes can’t hide their chintzy CGI set-design effects. Despite operating as a stand-alone affair that’s untethered to Marvel, DC, Star Wars, or another Happy Meal-friendly property, Red Notice ultimately reveals its own desire to be a franchise. That’s probably inevitable given today’s cinematic landscape. Yet it’s not totally depressing, since Hollywood could use a few more rock-'em-sock-'em movies in which one superstar tells another, “Does the back of your head look like a huge penis? The answer is yes.”",SMM_Doc6_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Positive,Red_Notice
126,SMM_Doc7_RedNotice,"Lifting its title from Interpol’s most-wanted list, “Dodgeball” director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s twisty treasure-hunt lark “Red Notice” blurs the lines between good guys and bad guys, and instead focuses on which of two notorious art thieves is better at breaking the law: sarcastic master forger Nolan Booth (a reliably whiny Ryan Reynolds) or his upscale nemesis, known only as “the Bishop” (a more wine-and-diney Gal Gadot). Their goal is to collect three ornamental orbs — worth some $300 million, but only as a set — originally gifted from Anthony to Cleopatra, then scattered to the corners of the globe. While Booth and the Bishop ricochet around the world, engaging in what amounts to a high-stakes Easter egg hunt, criminal profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) tries to bring them in, making for a fun, fast-paced and frequently amusing divertissement. Released by Netflix first in theaters Nov. 5, then streaming for subscribers a week later, “Red Notice” works surprisingly well for what it is. The script, which Thurber wrote himself, sets off blazing, as Booth steals Cleopatra’s first egg, narrowly escaping Hartley’s clutches, only to be apprehended when he arrives home in another hemisphere. Then the Bishop pops up, swipes the recovered prize, and lands Hartley in hot water, since the Interpol agent in charge, Inspector Das (Ritu Arya), now suspects the former FBI profiler of snagging it himself. Next thing Hartley knows, he’s sharing a cell with Booth in some remote Russian prison. We’re squarely in ’80s and ’90s action-movie territory here, and Thurber (who took improbability to new heights with the Rock-starring “Skyscraper”) certainly knows how to deliver wild and well-choreographed fights, chases and other stunt-driven set-pieces. Take that first heist, when Booth runs through the museum, only to find himself cornered in a room with a giant metal scaffold, which he proceeds to unhook one pin at a time, until the whole thing comes crashing down. In so doing, Reynolds nimbly outwits his pursuers the way Jackie Chan might have back in the day. The influence of Indiana Jones on Thurber’s splashy travelogue is undeniable. Also channeled are retro favorites like James Cameron’s “True Lies” (including a sexy tango in which a big lug in a tuxedo — Johnson, not Schwarzenegger, in this case — makes himself irresponsibly conspicuous while undercover). Even more fun than the retro action is the old-fashioned dynamic between these three frenemies, who must cautiously agree to work together in order to locate all of Cleopatra’s eggs. There’s an unmistakable screwball-comedy quality to the repartee, as unlikely partners Booth and Hartley bicker, or anytime the Bishop shows up and upstages the other two. It’s been widely reported that on the “Deadpool” movies, Reynolds improvises (or otherwise comes prepared with) many of his jokes, and the snarky thief he plays here feels like an extension of irreverent cut-ups he’s embodied before. Naturally, that attitude ruptures whatever reality audiences are supposed to buy into, but it’s worth it, since his zingers so often land (e.g., describing a target’s always-watching, always-listening security as “kinda like Alexa with guns,” or tussling with Johnson, then dropping a perfectly timed, “This is such a confusing erection”). Reynolds is one of the few contemporary leading men who can consistently get away with winking at the audience throughout a performance. Nearly everyone else in Hollywood is expected to act, or at least pretend to disappear into character. Along the same lines, no one buys Johnson as a mild-mannered FBI profiler (when Das tells him he doesn’t look the part, he responds with an appropriately weary “I get that a lot”), but it’s satisfying to suspend disbelief and see what the Rock will do with the role. Meanwhile, Gadot, who was propelled to A-list status by “Wonder Woman” just a few years ago, gets to demonstrate that she has a sense of humor, too, as the Bishop teases and torments the others. Her nickname hails from chess, though watching “Red Notice” feels more like a really good game of checkers, where the players keep things lively by jumping several of their opponent’s pieces in a single turn. These three are constantly outsmarting one another, such that Cleopatra’s eggs change hands often, while cuffs frequently bind the wrong wrists. Booth and Hartley are stuck together enough that they have no choice but to try getting along, as the now-framed fed breaks countless laws in order to clear his name, while a bromance slowly builds between them. Thurber has a peculiar take on the morality of all this art theft. The first heist takes place in a museum, but the next two are presented as essentially victimless crimes. The second egg belongs to a notorious arms dealer named Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos), while the third is stashed away in a secret Nazi bunker packed with stolen artifacts, so they’re essentially fair game. “Look for a box that says ‘MacGuffin,’” quips Reynolds, citing Hitchcock’s term for the otherwise-unimportant plot device that motivates a thriller. Once reunited, the three eggs don’t conjure some all-powerful laser beam from the sky (thank goodness, as that’s an even more tired cliché), but instead serve as the ultimate wedding present to a profligate billionaire’s spoiled daughter — and there’s a second surprise waiting to upstage the gift once the time comes. It’s all reasonably clever, so long as you don’t scrutinize it too closely. “Red Notice” could be Thurber’s spin on “National Treasure,” with just as much DNA from the RKO classic “Gunga Din.” The writer-director proves plenty adept at coming up with excuses for these characters to infiltrate and escape elaborately protected locations, and though the movie relies a bit too much on cumbersome exposition (the film’s first minutes are some of the clunkiest the genre has ever seen), it moves quickly enough that most audiences won’t stumble into — or even stop to question — the plot’s many holes. Like a skilled con artist, the movie steals your time, but leaves you feeling like you got the more advantageous end of the deal.",SMM_Doc7_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Positive,Red_Notice
127,SMM_Doc8_RedNotice,"You can’t argue with the muscular marquee value of headlining Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot in a slick, fast-paced action thriller laced with playful comedy, even if it’s an empty-calorie entertainment like Red Notice. Like many Netflix star vehicles, writer-director Rawson Marshall Thurber’s busy crime caper has more glossy industrial sheen than unique personality. But it’s diverting enough to justify the sequel so clearly set up in its final scenes, even if it’s unlikely to linger in the minds of many viewers beyond the end credits. Mostly, the derivative adventure keeps you occupied checking off the many films from which it borrows. Some of those, like the Indiana Jones movies, are acknowledged with a cheeky wink — for instance when Reynolds’ Nolan Booth, played with his trademark obnoxious smartass attitude, descends into a vault crammed with priceless antiquities looted by Nazis and whistles a couple of bars of John Williams’ Raiders of the Lost Ark theme. There are less overt but no less redolent inspirations throughout Red Notice — to the Bourne, Bond and Mission: Impossible movies, the National Treasure franchise and the Sean Connery-Catherine Zeta-Jones romp Entrapment. Maybe even a touch of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The production flashes the names of international locations spanning five continents across the screen at regular intervals, but because of COVID-19 restrictions, it ended up being shot entirely in Atlanta. Production designer Andy Nicholson has done a creditable job re-creating famous sites like Rome’s Castel Sant’Angelo in the buoyant opening scenes, though elsewhere, attentive eyes will be quick to spot studio sets. A South American jungle, complete with a waterfall and lagoon, almost conjures thoughts of the Maria Montez camp classic Cobra Woman. A mock TV history special sets up the backstory with the mystery surrounding three bejeweled eggs, each one more exquisite than the last, presented to Cleopatra by Mark Antony on their wedding day. The eggs were long believed to be a myth, until two of them turned up in 1907; one now sits in a Rome museum and the other with a private collector. But the whereabouts of the third remain unknown. Following an anonymous tip that notorious art criminal Nolan Booth is planning to lift the egg displayed at Castel Sant’Angelo, FBI behavioral analysis unit profiler John Hartley (Johnson) intervenes before the thief can exit the museum, triggering an accelerated chase through the Roman monument and surrounding streets that also involves Interpol inspector Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya). She seems less than thrilled with the unsolicited collaboration of Hartley, even more so when they both turn up to apprehend slippery Nolan and retrieve the treasure from his swanky pad in tropical Bali. When the egg again goes missing — with a fake being switched for the real thing — and a hefty cash transfer lands in Hartley’s account, Inspector Das presumes he’s in on the theft and adds him to her wanted list. The top-level international arrest warrant is called a “red notice,” hence the film’s generic title. Through some fuzzy plotting that probably doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny, Hartley is forced to team up with Nolan to clear his name and track down the real mastermind pulling the strings from behind the scenes, another notorious art thief known as “The Bishop.” No prizes for guessing who plays that devious shadow figure. She seems to be one step ahead of her rivals at every turn in a plot that keeps deftly springing double-crosses, surprise twists and long cons through to the very end, when all three of Cleopatra’s eggs are finally within reach. While Thurber’s script never quite shakes the feeling of déjà vu, it does deliver a steady stream of amusing one-liners, most of them given to Reynolds’ self-serving jokester. “You a top or a bottom?” Nolan asks from the bunk bed when Hartley finds himself sharing a Russian prison cell with the thief. Johnson, who worked with the writer-director previously on Central Intelligence and Skyscraper, does his usual affable deadpan with relaxed charm. He rolls his eyes every time he’s the butt of another one of Nolan’s wisecracks, in a begrudging rapport that inevitably morphs into bromance. The film’s keenest pleasures come when Gadot is onscreen, clearly having a ball shrugging off all traces of heroic nobility to play a ruthless badass who makes everything look easy. The Bishop (we never learn her real name) is a supreme tactician with useful connections all over the world, who handles herself formidably whether in high-kicking heels, with firearms, or by grabbing whatever ancient weaponry is at hand. There’s a fun, flirtatious buildup between her character and Johnson’s as they tango during a ritzy party at the Valencia mansion of a billionaire arms dealer named Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos), who owns the second egg. He keeps it in a high-security vault full of priceless artifacts, with entry requiring lots of cool gadgetry and smart subterfuge. The fight that ensues once the intruders are inside that confined space, like all the physical clashes, is expertly choreographed. The biggest set pieces, in addition to the high-speed Castel Sant’Angelo sequence, include a Russian prison break that turns out to be on an icy mountaintop, and a chase through the labyrinthine tunnels of an abandoned South American copper mine, with Hartley, Nolan and The Bishop in a deluxe 1931 Mercedes and Inspector Das and her team in pursuit in a jeep. Despite the ample gunfire and even some low-level torture scenes, there’s no real bloodshed or death, making this a generally family-friendly crime jaunt. Thurber pads out the character development by giving all three protagonists their respective daddy issues. But that half-baked psychology doesn’t do much to disguise the fact that they’re all playing minor variations on their familiar screen personas, right down to an amusing Vin Diesel gag that’s possibly a sly nod to The Rock’s old Fast and Furious feud. There’s nothing groundbreaking in Red Notice, but depending on your affection for the stars, you could do worse. You might even get a kick out of the weirdly gratuitous British pop star cameo.",SMM_Doc8_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Positive,Red_Notice
128,SMM_Doc9_RedNotice,"Early on in the Netflix thriller “Red Notice,” Interpol Inspector Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya) holds up one of the film’s three fabled eggs of Cleopatra and calls it a “priceless piece of ancient cultural whatnot.” She then throws it to the ground, shattering it. It’s not a real egg, but a fake substitute — as you’d expect, since you’re watching a movie, in which all the priceless valuables are props. Con men, art dealers and movies are all obsessed with lies and truth and the space between the two. Rawson Marshall Thurber’s clever script is a shell game of plot twists and head fakes which keeps daring you to notice, or care, that you’re watching a scam, a forgery and a fiction. It’s a shallow pleasure — but what can you expect from an art form that is constantly passing off plaster as gold? “Red Notice” starts with FBI profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) pursuing art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) as he tries to steal three ancient Egyptian eggs supposedly given to Cleopatra. Hartley and Booth are both being targeted by another art thief, The Bishop (Gal Gadot), who through cleverer-than-thou machinations gets them sent to an Interpol black site. The narrative tangles and re-tangles from there, racing through masked balls, South American jungles, improbable bullfights, and various betrayals. Imposter eggs and imposter backstories proliferate, and everyone turns out to be someone other than who you thought they were. In “Ocean’s 12,” part of the heist involved bringing a character played by Julia Roberts in to pretend to be Julia Roberts. “Red Notice” is similarly gleeful about the way the sham of moviemaking and the sham of cons overlap. In the first line of the movie, Inspector Das tells Hartley, “You’re not a cop,” to which he responds, “You’re right, I’m not.” Because, of course, he isn’t. He’s Dwayne Johnson, an actor playing a cop. (“You don’t look like a profiler,” another colleague observes. “I get that a lot,” says Johnson, who looks like a movie star.) Other winks are even more blatant. The characters are constantly referencing other films. If they’re traveling, they’re talking about “Sullivan’s Travels.” If they’re looking at a watch, they’re talking about “Pulp Fiction.” They even work in a reference to “Cats,” for some reason. In that bullfight scene, Booth tells Hartley to stay still because bulls can only see you when you move — and then there’s an extended discussion about whether Booth got that information from a nature documentary or is misremembering “Jurassic Park.” Is it David Attenborough or Richard Attenborough? Movies and real life, who can tell them apart? At one point, Booth critiques Bishop’s entrance; at another he offers to give notes on Hartley’s performance (or is it Johnson’s?) He says “scene!” at the end of scenes. He calls the egg they’re searching for a MacGuffin. The best grifters (and actors) make it a pleasure to participate in your own bamboozlement. One of the most transparent frauds in the movie is the joke that the film cares about art. Antiquities and valuable objects in movies from “V for Vendetta” to “Raiders of the Lost Ark” are supposed to signify sophistication and elevation. Appreciating a big honking egg prop is supposed to show that the characters are glamorous, and you’re glamorous, too, for spending time with them. The expensive knickknacks are part of the accouterment of luxury and taste, like vintage cars (yes, the movie has one of those) and elegant gowns (many of which are draped over Gadot at various points.) “Red Notice” absolutely revels in revealing the ersatz trash beneath its luxurious façade. Early on in the film, Hartley pours a soft drink onto an egg, and it dramatically dissolves into a bubbling puddle. Perhaps even more telling is a scene in which a minor character races right by the gorgeous jeweled eggs to fawn over Ed Sheeran (who boasts about having been in “Game of Thrones.”). The movie knows what its audience wants, and it’s not hoity-toity connoisseurship or “an ancient piece of pricelessness.” Its cartoon violence (the bullfight looks like it’s out of “Looney Tunes”), snarky quips, pretty humans in snug outfits and explosions. Booth uses his smooth sangfroid not to tastefully choose the best art to appreciate or pilfer, but to dismantle a scaffold in the middle of a pitched fight. What’s the point of preternatural suavity if you can’t weaponize it for chaos and cheap laughs? The fun sputters somewhat as the movie tries to resolve itself, and the sequel-telegraphing end feels decidedly forced. But that’s arguably part of the fun too. “Red Notice” is a lowest-common denominator star vehicle with fewer ambitions than your average Marvel Cinematic Universe slugfest. It picks up pretensions just to smash or dissolve them. No one would mistake it for great art. But it disavows any such aesthetic ambition with such sincere hucksterism that you start to wonder if there’s maybe a glimmer of cultural whatnot in amongst that false gold after all.",SMM_Doc9_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Positive,Red_Notice
129,SMM_Doc10_RedNotice,"Historically speaking, “Red Notice” should be unwatchable. For starters, Netflix’s previous fall blockbusters (e.g. “Bright,” “6 Underground”) have been very bad. Not just bad in the way that movies are bad, but bad in the way that war crimes are bad — they shouldn’t have been reviewed by critics so much as tried at the Hague. These are films so bad that Joe Rogan should have spent an episode of his podcast spreading crazy conspiracy theories about how they escaped from the Netflix content labs. These are films so bad that you half expect to see Forrest Gump stumbling through their crowd shots as part of his accidental journey through America’s defining crises. But at least they were directed by people with strong artistic sensibilities. “Red Notice,” on the other hand, is the brainchild of Rawson Marshall Thurber, a once-promising comedy director (“DodgeBall,” “We’re the Millers”) who was more fun to resent for his what if Colin Jost and Henry Cavill went into that machine from “The Fly” together good looks than for his role in enabling Dwayne Johnson’s quixotic quest to simultaneously become the most charismatic and least interesting movie star of all time. Thurber may not be quite as complicit as “San Andreas” and “Rampage” auteur Brad Peyton, but “Central Intelligence” and “Skyscraper” are both summer blockbusters so bland they helped to deflate the entire tradition of such tentpoles. Whatever points they scored for “originality” were negated by their perverse determination to seem mass-produced. That Thurber and Johnson’s latest collaboration is reportedly the most expensive movie Netflix has ever made would be reason enough to assume that “Red Notice” is just another high-concept spectacle in which the bravery of Johnson’s character is betrayed by the actor-producer’s life-threatening allergy to creative risk. Add Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot into the mix — two other A-list stars whose sense of range seems to end with their costumes — and you have such a perfect storm of modern Hollywood mediocrity that people might start hoarding toilet paper and canned goods before it reaches land. Alas, you already know where this is going: Call it an early Hanukkah miracle (as one drop of inspiration somehow manages to power this movie for almost two full hours), but “Red Notice” is a lot of fun, if often in spite of itself. While in essence still the kind of flavorless slop that a peevish critic might have expected Netflix to produce from these ingredients, this globe-hopping tale of cops and robbers on the hunt for Nazi gold is glazed with enough panache, humor, and franchise-thirsty ambition to feel like it isn’t taking the audience for granted. There’s precious little in “Red Notice” that people haven’t seen Johnson do before (with the possible exception of the part when his character name-checks 19th-century Scottish artist William Strang), but at least his latest attempt at a swashbuckling throwback is liberated from the sort of waterlogged mythology that sank Disney’s “Jungle Cruise.” Enjoyably cartoonish set pieces keep the movie light on its feet, a carousel of exotic locations make sure you never have to think about the MacGuffin, and Reynolds — in a rare display of discretion — only calls his co-star “baldilocks” once. In 2021, that counts as some kind of win. At its best, “Red Notice” feels like a glam and glossy live-action riff on “Lupin the Third,” with a little “Uncharted” mixed in for good measure before the movie takes a late swerve into another genre altogether. Reynolds is Nolan Booth, the world’s greatest art thief and a general cad. Johnson is John Hartley, the boulder-sized FBI profiler who’s been tracking Booth around the world, and seems hellbent on stopping him from stealing all three of Cleopatra’s jewel-encrusted eggs (priceless treasures that an Egyptian billionaire hopes to give his daughter as a wedding present). Gadot is the wild card between these two silly boys, playing the only person on the planet capable of beating Nolan at his own game; she’s known only as “The Bishop,” though it’s unclear why she chose that title, or what pieces the other characters might represent on her chess board. Unsurprisingly, the actress’ most important function in the movie is to wear slinky dresses for Reynolds and Johnson to drool on. The red number she wears to the villain’s “Eyes Wide Shut”-like masquerade party stands out for compelling a hyper-masculine Dwayne Johnson character to admit that sex exists and is something he might be interested in having one day. Needless to say, hearts will be stolen before everyone in this bizarre love triangle reveals their angle. And it isn’t long before things go screwy and people begin to switch sides, as Inspector Urvashi Das (Ritu Arya) races to the conclusion that Hartley — her partner! — is actually behind the heist that unfolds during the opening sequence, a high-energy set piece that starts with one of the three Cleopatra eggs being nicked from a Rome museum in plain sight. Cut to: Hartley and Nolan bunking together in a black site prison that’s perched so high atop a snowy Russian peak that not even eagles would dare to break them free. The Bishop has one of the eggs, a Napoleonic arms dealer named Sotto Voce (Chris Diamantopoulos) has another, Nolan is the only person alive who knows where the third one might be, and the magnate willing to pay $300 million if someone brings him the ancient treasures by the night of his daughter’s nuptials won’t fork over a penny for anything short of a full set. And so begins a wild goose chase that stretches from a Siberian gulag to a South American Nazi bunker and all points in between as friends become enemies, enemies become friends, everyone airs their daddy issues, and nobody actually gets hurt (including the various henchmen our heroes meet along the way). Nobody actually leaves Atlanta, either, as the pandemic cramped Thurber’s plans for an international shoot, and forced his team to fake a series of far-flung locations in a way that more closely reflects the Marvel approach to moviemaking than it does the old school adventures that “Red Notice” hopes to exhume. Not unlike the hologram tech that Nolan uses to swipe priceless artifacts from museum showrooms, the illusion holds for just long enough to get the job done. That the Russian jail is such a ridiculous place helps to launder its non-reality, and Thurber grounds Hartley and Nolan’s big escape from it in bite-sized human details so that the more heightened beats to come feel like they stem from the same comic tone; the sight gag of a prison guard using a shirtless photo of Putin as his iPhone background helps butter you up to believe the huge stunt that follows a few minutes later, when Hartley turns a helicopter just in time for a rocket to pass through both of its open doors. Of course, that particular joke is an outlier in a politically and emotionally anodyne movie that keeps with Johnson’s soul-deadening refusal to spend his star capital on anything that might someday cost him a vote. The first hour of “Red Notice” does such a fine job of threading the needle between hard-boiled action and comic absurdity that its ends justify their means and the film’s cast is free to lean on their respective brands as a crutch. Does it make sense that Nolan is a clumsy buffoon one minute, and the most gifted prop fighter since Jackie Chan the next? Absolutely not, but it’s fun to watch Reynolds use scaffolding to politely incapacitate some featured extras while Markus Förderer’s gravity-defying camera zooms around the well-choreographed chaos like a drunken mosquito. It’s also telling that Reynolds’ best moments are blocked, and not improvised; his quips are a bit sharper than usual (save for the occasional “dipdick” and other such dumbass retorts that sneak through just often enough to remind you to be grateful that it doesn’t happen more often), but his disaffected schtick is still mighty stale without a “Free Guy”-level concept to keep it fresh. In fact, Thurber’s film is funniest when it functions as a featherlight commentary on its various screen personas. There’s a cutesy bit at the masquerade ball when Gadot pretends not to recognize all 23 square feet of Dwayne Johnson behind his eye mask, and that same in-on-the-joke energy flows through almost every minute of a breezy lark that offers a few pennies of fun on a $200 million budget… a budget that falls well short of whatever Thurber needed to sell the Atlanta of it all the whole way through, as the third act is such an embarrassing parade of TikTok-level green screen that it seems like the film was shot in sequence and we’re watching it run out of money in real time. While the movie sometimes hides behind its own derivativeness in lieu of daring to play things straight — the references fly fast and furious long before a punchline is made at Vin Diesel’s expense — “Red Notice” never loses sight of the visual shorthand that comes with bonafide stardom, nor the simple joy of seeing very famous people make total fools of themselves for a laugh. Sometimes we even get to laugh along with them. Empty calories aren’t all created equal, and this is the first thing the Rock has cooked up in a long time that might actually leave you hungry for more.",SMM_Doc10_RedNotice,SMM,Action,Positive,Red_Notice
130,RWM_Doc1_MissionImpossibleFallout,"“Mission: Impossible — Fallout” starts out strong and gets better and better. And then, just when you know it can’t get any better than it already is, it gets even better than that, until everybody staggers out of the theater exhausted and exhilarated. It’s what a summer movie used to be and should be. It’s just terrific.

Before the credits are even flashed onto the screen, “Fallout” has already delivered more excitement, narrative interest and surprises than most action movies do in two hours. The thought crosses the mind: Where can it go from here? The answer is pretty much everywhere. It keeps on going and going, following one exciting sequence with another and then another.

There are two things to marvel at, aside from the fact that Tom Cruise is 56 and only now has begun to look like he might be in his 40s. The first is how these action sequences are devised. Most action movies deal in cliches, and their only innovation is to make the cliches bigger — bigger explosions, bigger car crashes, bigger chases — and it never really works. But “Fallout” consistently demonstrates an astonishing creative invention in these sequences. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (“Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation”) comes up with new ways of doing things, and new ways within those ways. Every time you think you’ve outguessed him, you haven’t.

The second marvel is yet more impressive, and that’s that the effectiveness of the action has to do with more than thrills and titillation. In “Fallout,” every leap, chase and tense moment is bound to the story and to the personal relationships within that story. Having Cruise at the center certainly helps — everybody likes Tom Cruise, including all the people who tell you they don’t, and so there’s a rooting interest. But this goes beyond Cruise. This is story construction, character creation and a directorial instinct for when to ease off the pedal and when to floor it. The stakes are high — of course they are. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is given a choice assignment, to find three silver-colored balls of plutonium, a little bigger than a bocce ball, that have been stolen from the Russians and are being sold on the black market. He teams up with his crew, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), and goes to make the purchase, but ends up blowing the assignment. He screws up for some good reasons, but he screws up all the same, and the plutonium gets into the hands of a nihilistic terror group that thinks that the path to peace is through great suffering, or some nonsense like that.

The details are unimportant. All you need to know is that they’re crazy and want to destroy the world.

So now Ethan has to find the terrorists, and also the people working with the terrorists, and he has to assume a false identity for a time, and hang out in Paris and London and somewhere in Asia. ... He’s doing all sorts of things, while people are coming at him from every direction, and while one of his own men, played by Henry Cavill, is plotting to discredit him. Yet as complicated as “Fallout” is, and as difficult it would be to describe, with certainty, every turn of the story and what it means, the movie is always clear in terms of what’s going on in the moment.

For example, there’s a scene in Paris, in which Ethan and his group are trying to steal a heavily guarded prisoner from the French police. But in order to do so, they have to double-cross the underworld characters they’re working with and manage, somehow, not to hurt a single Paris policeman. The sequence seems to go on for about a half hour, and every moment is specific and riveting. And that’s not even the best sequence in the movie.

One of the least appreciated things about Cruise, in general, is that the women in his action movies are rarely appendages. They’re always in the thick of things, and they’re always interesting in their own right. Rebecca Ferguson is back as Ilsa, complicating everything by showing up on a motorcycle and shooting at people, for reasons that become clear only later. Michelle Monaghan has somewhat less fun as Ethan’s ex-wife, but Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret on Netflix’s “The Crown”) is full of insinuation and mischief as an international arms broker known as White Widow, smiling at Cruise like she’s about to devour him, and acting like a villainess on the old “Batman” TV show. Of course, one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that so much of what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are tangible.

With “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” Cruise and McQuarrie have made the best film in the franchise’s history and the most enjoyable and exciting action movie in several years.",RWM_Doc1_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Positive,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
131,RWM_Doc2_MissionImpossibleFallout,"The sixth movie in producer-star Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series is a marvel of American engineering. This exciting, semi-adult cartoon of espionage could have been laid out in an intricate schematic instead of a screenplay. Its savvy amalgamation of gimmickry, glamour, and athletics, on the one hand, and spy games played like mind games, on the other, generates tension and release for a super-swift 147 minutes.

To maintain rooting interest, the film injects a shot of idealism every 20 minutes. Cruise’s Impossible Missions Force (IMF) agent, Ethan Hunt, refuses to sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good. He won’t leave any IMF agent behind. When he goes undercover with corrupt movers and shakers, he strategizes to avoid killing other law enforcers. He even apologizes to a Parisian parking cop wounded in the crossfire.

The writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie, has worked with Cruise for over a decade, writing and co-producing Valkyrie (2008) and writing and directing the previous Mission: Impossible movie, Rogue Nation (2015), as well as Jack Reacher (2012). He’s also done credited or uncredited work on the scripts for The Edge of Tomorrow (2014), The Mummy (2017), and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011). He cleverly uses Hunt’s moral integrity as a source of suspense. We wonder, “How can he keep his conscience clean and get the job done this time?” He also knows how to keep the drama in his star’s wheelhouse, mostly by keeping him moving. McQuarrie builds extreme action and “give” into each of the film’s acts, enabling Cruise’s Hunt to test his mettle and his metal, whether he’s operating a vintage BMW sedan or a cutting-edge Airbus helicopter. Like Richard Lester’s famous 1959 comedy short, this is a running, jumping, and standing-still film—although the closest Hunt comes to standing still is when stuntman/actor Liang Yang wraps a sink-pipe around Cruise’s neck.

The movie dips into bathetic hero-worship only when it describes the toll it has taken on Hunt to divorce his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) for her protection. (Quelle surprise!) It’s not enough for that brass-tacks agent Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) to rumble Hunt’s praises. We must hear Julia herself, a humanitarian nurse, give her ex-husband credit for pushing her to lead a purposeful life. We briefly fear that the movie will turn into a Trump cabinet meeting lovefest. Will IMF agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) proclaim Ethan “the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life?” Luckily, the filmmakers restrain themselves. The result is a spiffy, crowd-pleasing contraption. Getting a canny writer-director like McQuarrie to take the helm, twice in a row, ensures the continuity of melodrama and spectacle. His films lack the improbable lilt of Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol, the hyper-personal paranoia and voyeurism of Brian De Palma’s vision in the first film, or the romanticism of the John Woo–directed, Robert Towne–scripted M:I 2. But they’re a big step up from J.J. Abrams’s typically mechanical M:I 3. For the second time, McQuarrie’s resourcefulness and energy refresh the by-now familiar tale of Hunt beating the clock to foil yet another disillusioned agent turned nihilistic madman. This time the top villain is the mysterious “John Lark,” who aims to shock our decadent global civilization into starting over. He gathers the materials to nuke three holy cities: Rome, Mecca, and, of course, Jerusalem, close to Armageddon’s original location. Lark’s atheistic credo: “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.”

The lunatic visionary of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), comes back into play, this time as a bargaining chip. A CIA agent named Walker, aka The Hammer (Henry Cavill), has crushed Solomon’s network of embittered ops (“the Syndicate”), making way for Lark’s apostles, who really are called “the Apostles.” Angela Bassett’s Erica Sloan, the new CIA director, orders that Walker be part of Ethan’s mission. Will Walker be competitor, friend, or foe?

The inspiration behind the big-screen M:I series has been to combine the luxurious and/or exotic surfaces of the James Bond movies with a spy vs. spy background as bleak as John le Carré’s. Secret and special services and police and security agencies compete for dominance within each country, and they work at cross-purposes on the global stage. McQuarrie puts these conflicts into sleek comic-strip form. Except for the IMF regulars, everyone’s allegiance is in doubt from the moment they show up on screen. That includes the returning British operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who was Hunt’s match in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.  One character who’s slippery to the end is the chic but lethal arms dealer known as “the White Widow,” who puts on an elegant gala as a British philanthropist in Paris when she isn’t striking dirty deals or wielding a mean butterfly knife. Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in The Crown’s first two seasons) plays her superbly and knowingly, as if in homage to another Vanessa, Redgrave. Indeed, Redgrave played the arms dealer “Max” in the first film, and, in a highly touted Easter egg, the White Widow refers to Max as her mother.

Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation) uses the giant screen to exploit the glittering nocturnal allure of Paris’s Grand Palais and the sun-kissed, sky-scraping grandeur of New Zealand’s Southern Alps (masquerading as Kashmir). He and the rest of McQuarrie’s team provide the wow factor while Cruise supplies the whoa factor, whether he’s performing aero-acrobatics during a HALO jump, hanging from tall buildings and cliff walls, or chasing a heartless enemy through perilous canyons as he tries to avert nuclear disaster. And of course we get the obligatory “See Tom run” scene, highlighting, under duress, his perfect form (tight core, efficient, air-chopping arms). Age and experience have burned off Cruise’s “Tom Terrific” over-eagerness. He’s grown into his cockiness and maintains an action-star charisma. He masters a dynamic evasiveness—his face never becomes entirely blank. It keeps us guessing about Hunt’s next move. The supporting cast keys into his intensity. This time out, Kirby may be the only one who does the completely unexpected, but Alec Baldwin is gratifyingly crisp as the IMF Secretary, and Pegg, though not as amusing as in previous outings, projects a careworn version of his exuberance that’s unusually affecting. And it’s sweet to see the resemblance between Ferguson and Monaghan: Hunt is a soft touch for a certain type.  

As sensational entertainments go, the Mission: Impossible movies have been remarkably sophisticated. Cruise and his M:I collaborators hark back to the “thrill pictures” of Harold Lloyd in their skill at setting up the high-risk antics stuntpeople call “gags.” They plant their capers in the real physical universe and design them to build one gut-churn upon another. McQuarrie and company realize that part of the visceral charge in movies from the days of Lloyd and Douglas Fairbanks to Jackie Chan and Cruise comes from the audience’s belief that our action star/hero is risking life and limb in front of our very eyes. (And we know that Cruise does take risks and has broken bones.)

But unlike the makers of (for example) the good-natured Dwayne Johnson vehicle Skyscraper, the M:I filmmakers don’t stop there. The M:I team has learned that to slay the audience, a stunt gag must escalate in the manner of classic silent-comedy gags, building in stages. As James Agee wrote in “Comedy’s Greatest Era,” the ultimate step was “the boffo . . . the laugh that kills.” Indeed, the best parts of Mission: Impossible – Fallout are so skillfully calibrated and outrageous that they’re both hair-raising and inexplicably gleeful.  

Agee wrote that an ideal gag “would bring the victim up the ladder of laughs by cruelly controlled degrees to the top rung, and would then proceed to wobble, shake, wave and brandish the ladder until he groaned for mercy.” That’s what Mission: Impossible – Fallout does, too. I stayed to the final credit, in case there was a clever tag, but I didn’t feel cheated when there wasn’t one. I needed the time to catch my breath.

132,RWM_Doc3_MissionImpossibleFallout,"In 2015, both James Bond and Ethan Hunt went rogue. MI6 and IMF, their sophisticated secret-service organizations, were being disbanded by governments that had stopped trusting in old-school one-man missions. The transatlantic winds merged; the situations of both our heroes were identical. The stakes, therefore, were sky-high – they were essentially battling for relevance, for survival in a new world marked by strategic rationality and modern filmmaking. They were fighting for individuality and disorder. Their entire genre was in danger.

Out of them, however, it’s only Hunt – guided by director Christopher McQuarrie – that was hailed. Rogue Nation was a slick, tense, imaginative, brave and sinewy work of kinetic art. But Bond’s Spectre, helmed by Sam Mendes, was a hard film to like. It’s because, after Skyfall had humanized the famous British double agent, people had begun to engage with Bond on an emotional level. It wasn’t so much the physicality and daring anymore, but the ‘intellectuality’ of his story that came under scrutiny.

Except for perhaps during J.J. Abrams’ Mission: Impossible III, Hunt has had no such baggage. Over the next two installments, Brad Bird and McQuarrie turned the iconic Tom Cruise avatar into something of a haunted superhero. The 56-year-old Hollywood superstar knows that the very concept of a fearless 56-year-old doing crazy stunts and not over-thinking his plans is what keeps the franchise so endearing – and enduring. Like, say, a John McClane taking to technology. He is then hardly a spy thriller anymore – in fact, Cruise is deliberately patronizing (combine this with the arrival of Simon Pegg as ‘funnyman’ Benji since Ghost Protocol) and even somewhat indolent during the expository portions. For him the script is just a filler to reach the next gravity-defying stunt. Almost every new set piece begins with him yelling, “I’ll figure it out” – that is, dumping the plot and throwing caution to the wind (literally). Hunt isn’t here to speak; he’s here to jump. Which is why it’s a bit surprising that McQuarrie, a staunch believer in the “action speaks louder than words” formula, over-designs the stakes of Mission: Impossible – Fallout (otherwise, ironically, known as MI6). It’s almost like he tries to make Hunt’s new mission sound…possible. That’s not to say the set pieces aren’t breathless – a high-altitude skydive over mainland Europe, an endless chase sequence across Paris and a ridiculous helicopter chase over the Himalayas are exquisitely crafted pieces of pure cinema. But when they appear, we feel relieved rather than anticipatory. In fact, the action is far more coherent than the plot. It’s easier to follow the exact mechanics and geographical awareness of Hunt within a choreographed scene than map the events and characters and deceits that lead him to these scenes. The film begins with Hunt dreaming about his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). His small IMF team messes up a mission in Berlin, which leads to nuclear warheads falling into the hands of a shadowy group called The Apostles. John Lark is a key name thrown around randomly. Simultaneously, the CIA, led by a new chief (Angela Bassett), puts an assassin (Henry Cavill) in charge of babysitting Hunt’s pursuit of redemption. Casting a known face like Cavill – whose moustache is far more expressive than his face – is not the most elegant way to deal with a story full of unidentified villains. Hunt discovers that he will have to trade psychopathic ex-spy Solomon Lane for the warheads; at one point, three different groups are eyeing his bike-heist across Paris.

Throw in the complex return of MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the strangeness of a corrupt broker called The White Widow (The Crown’s fantastic Vanessa Kirby) and the desperation of IMF head and former CIA director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) – and we have a movie, not unlike The Dark Knight Rises, clumsily trying to lend perspective and heft to the world its hero has to save. Lorne Balfe’s score, too, is more Hans Zimmer-ish in its reading of pace and themes, while Hunt’s experiences are laced with reminders of his near-Batman-esque gift of haunted detachment. You almost wonder: does the film need to operate on the fringes of a Nolan-verse at all?

Fallout is fun when it’s “Impossible,” just not so much during the Mission buildups in between. It thrives on us finding humour in just how audacious and clear-minded some of its action is – only, I’m not sure it wants us to wryly nod our heads in disbelief even when Hunt isn’t on screen. It’s frivolous plotting, like a cold side extending the wait for the main dish. This happens quite often, but Cruise’s boundless energy and unerring faith in the franchise immediately distracts us from the film’s lack of self-awareness. He directs viewers to what is important, and to what might eventually set this legacy apart from an existential Bond series, a tireless Bourne series and the dozens of overcooked superhero franchises dotting our times. Much of our enjoyment of the Mission: Impossible series is derived from the fact that filmmakers continue to challenge Cruise’s ageing body and our ageing minds – and by extension, the traditional core of action filmmaking. It seems to be getting better with every installment not because these are actually better genre movies – they’re not in the same league as a Mad Max: Fury Road or The Raid: Redemption – but because they remain loyal to a form that an entire generation has been forced to outlive. The mess of the current blockbuster landscape makes them shine brighter than they perhaps might have a decade ago. To McQuarrie’s credit, he clearly knows that he is creating no masterpiece, and counts on the fact that viewers admire his vision in context of the era Cruise defies.

In a sense, Fallout, too, is inherently nostalgic, forsaking fancy visual effects and digital wizardry to present a cute save-the-world fairytale. Hunt, unlike Bond, continues to embody the last-man-standing spirit of his franchise – he counts on the stray bullets out of nowhere to save him when he’s down, and walks the thin line linking surrealism and parody. Being an agent of chaos is, despite its inherent complications, infinitely more interesting than saving the planet from chaos – he’d probably make an impenetrable villain, should the makers want to collide the MI universe with other morally conflicted ones.

Hunt is, by merely existing in 2018, a Rogue Nation resisting Fallout in an age populated with capes and punchlines. Everything he does simply accentuates this underdog effect. It should come as no surprise then that the weakest link of his latest adventure is the guy who plays Superman.",RWM_Doc3_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Positive,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
133,RWM_Doc4_MissionImpossibleFallout,"Mission Impossible is the greatest film franchise in cinematic history. What other series has had the consistent quality? None (well, maybe The Thin Man). Each film, since Tom Cruise‘s Ethan Hunt first graced the screen, has been better than the last. Each film, carries with it a new height of dare-devil exploits. Indeed, the second half of the series, the 4-6 trilogy could vie as one of the best trilogies ever. Much like James Bond, Mission Impossible‘s stories are simple. They rely on the same tropes and themes to get by, but more so than Bond, Mission Impossible has been more capable of twisting our expectations to create can’t miss blockbusters that haven’t worn thin.

The opening to Mission Impossible: Fallout is a barrage of exposition. From a projected reel of film hidden, we learn that Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has teamed with a shadowy terrorist with no known identity, except the pseudonym John Lark. They have stolen plutonium and plan to detonate it, thereby causing the collapse of the Old World Order and, in the process, helping a cell of doomsayers known as the Apostles. Hunt’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to track down the stolen plutonium. The actors, together for their third film, are comfortable in each other’s pockets. Fallout is a true sequel to Rogue Nation, so while you will be able to comfortably view the film, you may need a tiny bit of catch up. Nevertheless, the script plants plenty of clues for you to keep up. Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames), and Hunt are a perfect trio, and the film is actually quite funny. The banter between these three provide levity in an action film that brings near non-stop intensity. They’re joined by a CIA operative named August Walker (Henry Cavill). Cavill, as the bulldozer in a suit assigned to Hunt’s team, demonstrates an ice-cold persona and a stylin’ stash. They’re opposed by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a take the best deal there is femme fatale. Fallout also marks the return of Rebecca Ferguson‘s Ilsa.

Fallout, for all of its action, is stylistically immaculate. In fact, it can be a quiet and nearly silent film, with a rapacious and eerie string-laden score accompanying certain sequences. The sound design is technical perfection. These scenes, and the action accompanying, are so well choreographed the results are dizzying. The stunts are pristine and seamless and the fighting choreography is targeted and pinned to the very millisecond. Many of these stunt sequences are going to be “ohh’d” and “aww’d” for sometime, from the building jumping scene, to the skydiving sequence, the helicopter chase, and the bathroom tussle (that phrase sounded better in my head). Fallout is worth it just for these moments, never mind the story. And well, the story is solid. It is your typical Mission Impossible tale, as these spies jet from Belfast, to Berlin, Paris, and London. However, that tale is only the bare bones of the script. The elements are so familiar to us that it’s a genre unto itself. Screenwriter and director Christopher McQuarrie plays on these tropes and elements to surprise us and to question their very existences. Hunt has always operated in a world where he can be burned at any second, where friends can quickly become foes. Nevertheless, those foes have always existed for the benefit of a country. Now, we know of no benefit. Indeed, the villains here: John Lark, the Widow, Solomon Lane and his Apostles work for no country, no government agency. They work for themselves. The entirety of the film becomes a checkmate barrage as double and triple crosses occur to the point of it being an impossibility to keep up. And the concept isn’t foreign (no pun intended, and certainly not a knock against Fallout). We can trace this new trope, soldiers without allegiances within the spy genre, back to Skyfall.

Fallout owes much to Skyfall, and not just the word “fall.” There are several scenes that have clearly been reinvented. As stated prior, they continue the war without borders motif. That is, in this digital world we don’t know who our enemies are. And both MI6 in Skyfall and IMF in Fallout are considered outdated for their times. “IMF is a bunch of kids in Halloween masks,” quips Sloan (Angela Bassett), head of the CIA. Fallout even borrows the underground caverns setting, or the Churchill bunker tunnels in Skyfall, through much of the film. They both combine the old with the new. If there’s one difference between Skyfall and Fallout, it’s the cinematography. Skyfall was a brightly lit film, even in the manor scenes. The color and lighting was vivid and crisp. Fallout‘s cinematography is murky and diffused. It follows the same blurred lines as the operatives at its center. And while Hunt is never the forlorn rundown that is Daniel Craig’s Bond, he is damaged. Much like Craig’s Bond, he’s tired of losing, losing those close to him, losing a normal life. However, he’s never able to walk away. Bond usually comes back because he’s a natural born killer. He’s good at it. Hunt returns because he has a Superman complex, a moral complex.

Hunt is a modern-day Superman. Yes, that’s an easy comparison considering Cavill’s involvement in the film, but Hunt displays the same traits. Hunt is self-sacrificial, believes the one life to be as important as the million, and leaps tall buildings in a single bound. Seriously! As Hunt chases Lane, he leaps from building-to-building, at times, running faster than a speeding bullet. Nevertheless, he’s a humanistic Superman. He becomes battered and bruised, yet is unrelenting. While Superman is an unachievable goal for mere mortals, made to demonstrate human perfection, Hunt is the mortal equivalence, giving hope for the mere fact of being human. And much like Luther, we implicitly trust that he will succeed.

And while watching a 56 year-old Cruise perform harrowing stunt after harrowing stunt, we’re left in amazement. We may even bemuse what may happen when Cruise must walk away (then again Harrison Ford is suiting up as Indiana Jones at 78). Still, Cruise brings a blockbuster stardom that’s rarely seen today. He’s always a 10 kilowatt smile away from a massive hit, even in the Autumn of his career. If you will, his magnetism always points north. The series has seen consistent quality. In fact, many, including myself, would argue that the quality has only increased from film-to-film. Much of that is down to Cruise, who still finds exuberance and passion in a role he’s occupied for 22 years. Indeed, the series has never had a dud, and with Mission Impossible: Fallout, Cruise has carried another new chapter in the greatest film franchise in the history of cinema.",RWM_Doc4_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Positive,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
134,RWM_Doc5_MissionImpossibleFallout,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout opens grungy, with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sleeping rough in a safehouse, suffering apocalyptic dreams of his wedding, interrupted by a mushroom cloud. From the start, Fallout picks Hunt apart, trying to peer inside a character resistant to examination after five movies of mythic labors.

James Bond has gone through this introspective impulse before, most recently with Daniel Craig's 007, who exposed the superspy's tuxedoed sophistication as a thin veneer covering a wrecking ball. But where the Bond series has gotten down in the muck, exposing the brutality of its protagonist's methods—MI6 not so much assigning him, as letting him off a leash—Mission: Impossible has taken the opposite approach, deifying Hunt as mankind's unbreakable savior. At several points, Fallout presents dark possibilities, alternate scenarios for the consequences of failure. How (not if) Hunt defies fate and rewrites, with sheer will, the world's future, becomes the primary narrative tension—the question not so much whether or not Hunt will triumph, but just how high a scenario can be stacked against him.

The plot is flimsy—we're chasing nukes again—but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, returned from Rogue Nation (PSA: unlike the rest of the series, Fallout is in close-continuity with the previous entry), is by now expert at knotting new complications into straightforward plot points. He stacks body doubles, mask twists, assassination attempts and goons, then resolves them all in the next spectacular action sequence.  Fallout has several signature action stunts, including a HALO jump over Paris and bone-breaking jumps, all helpfully included in the opening credits so you know what you're getting. But it's a fight in a well-lit bathroom that most had me clenching my hands like angry Arthur. Pitting Hunt and a partner against one man, the fight is body-slamming, tile-destroying carnage, with a choreographic intensity rarely seen outside of The Raid movies. The action throughout is of a similar caliber. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an unrelentingly consistent action movie, with not a single sequence wasted before the next big stunt.

Fallout may not have a sequence to match Hunt's Burj Khalifa climb in Ghost Protocol—Cruise kicking off the face of the world's tallest skyscraper into an escape trajectory arc is the signature stunt of this decade at least—but it has substantial advantages over the fourth Mission: Impossible (often declared the series' best), most notably its abundance of worthy opponents, including the return of Rogue Nation's The Syndicate leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), now sporting a frazzled detainee beard. But more than villains, Fallout throws up human obstacles, including kill-first-questions-later CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), still trying to work her way back into the good graces of MI6 after the events of Rogue Nation, and Sloan's right-hand assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill).

Fallout is downright labyrinthine in its shifting loyalties, with only Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) providing an unswerving core. Even Hunt is called into question, though Fallout treats it more like a fun counterfactual than daring to try and trick us. In one satisfying aside, we get a glimpse of a Hunt who's thrown away his moral code and rampages freely. Sometimes Fallout can get more confusing than it actually is, especially when it indulges in a taste of the Shakespearean dramas playing out within the household of White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), an enigmatic philanthropist at the center of every deal.

But more often, because Hunt is an unstoppable, smiling battering ram, human nuance is outsourced to secondary characters to excellent effect. For much of the movie, Faust exists to disrupt Hunt's plans—even if they seem to share some of the same objectives—popping up at inopportune moments, perhaps with a submachine gun. New character Walker becomes a more immediate foil, his pretty-boy mustache barely covering a brutalizing efficiency. Cavill and Bassett combine to become the perfect embodiment of the CIA, portrayed in Fallout as an organization at-odds with IMF and a parody of realpolitik prone to moral compromise, if not outright subversion, in the name of a compromised pragmatism—spywork adrift of Hunt's holy mission.",RWM_Doc5_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Positive,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
135,RWM_Doc6_MissionImpossibleFallout,"Mission: Impossible – Fallout had the best opening weekend of the entire series with $61.2 million (and another $94.6 million overseas). This is the film Tom Cruise broke his ankle on and the film Henry Cavill just had to have a mustache for that made those re-shoots for Justice League have such disastrous results. The sequel has a whopping 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 Metascore on Metacritic. Critics and the general movie-going audience emphatically and enthusiastically adore this film and personally it doesn’t register why the Mission: Impossible franchise is so cherished by movie lovers.

Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, Sean Harris as villain Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust all return from Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation; this is the first film where a director and a villain have returned from a previous film. The technical aspects of the film are the easiest to admire and the action sequences are outstandingly breathtaking. The big action sequences include the parachute/free fall sequence with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and August Walker (Henry Cavill), the bathroom brawl with Hunt, Walker, and John Lark, Hunt’s motorcycle chase, Hunt running and jumping across rooftops, and the insane helicopter chase. It’s ridiculous (in a good way) how much room cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) gives each sequence; these are scenes made for seeing and experiencing in IMAX. You can tell that the majority of the stunts were pulled off practically and green screens and computer generated effects are utilized minimally. The most impressive sequence is the motorcycle chase because Tom Cruise races through the wrong side of traffic without a helmet in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

But the helicopter chase features Cruise climbing up a rope dangling in the air while the helicopter is airborne. These sequences are extremely open with perspectives that not only make you feel like you’re with Tom Cruise being just as nuts and exhilarating as he is, but also seem to be making the statement that Cruise is still crazy enough to do the majority of his own stunts at the age of 56 despite his saggy jowls. Many on social media were claiming that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is nonstop action over its nearly 150-minute runtime, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The film seems to be attempting this never ending adrenaline rush found within the likes of films like Mad Max: Fury Road and Speed, but it fails to do so. The action is superb, but everything in between is extraordinarily dull. Missing the first and third films in the franchise may have contributed to that, but there’s not much to miss here if you haven’t seen the other films in the franchise.

Hunt obviously still cares about his ex-wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), but currently has a connection with Ilsa Faust. The spy element of the sequel feels so cliché and predictable as every twist and big reveal can easily be predicted even if this is your first Mission: Impossible film. The inclusion of a bomb in a Mission: Impossible film feels explosively juvenile at this point and you legitimately have no investment in these characters whatsoever. With every Mission: Impossible film that’s released, it seems like its main purpose is for Tom Cruise to be like Mad TV’s Stuart and yell, “Look what I can do!” before partaking in extracurricular activities a man in his fifties should probably be distancing himself from. To be fair, Cruise is still more than capable of doing incredible action films and is generally a part of films that aim to be exciting for everyone.

Fallout is extraordinary if you scrutinize without any sort of context. The film knows how to make your pulse race and your palms sweat as you gasp for breath. But the story is the same as any other Mission: Impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes. There’s no substance here and impressive action doesn’t make up for a defused storyline.",RWM_Doc6_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Negative,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
136,RWM_Doc7_MissionImpossibleFallout,"By now the entire world knows that Mission: Impossible — Fallout purports to be the most action-packed, breath-baiting movie ever made — or so advises film authorities who have unanimously given in to Hollywood’s hard sell and given up on artistic standards. Every new blockbuster must be recognized as the acme of a genre — until the next one is hyped. A popular film series is now sacrosanct, especially when it is so clearly devised according to proven formula.

Back in 1996, when the first Mission: Impossible movie was nearing completion, I lucked upon the opportunity to ask director Brian De Palma how the production was going. “Oh, you mean, Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible!” the demoralized maestro joked. Today, critics are not joking when they praise Fallout as “the reason we go to the movies” (an actual repeat of reviews for Peter Jackson’s forgettable King Kong remake).

Fallout fits into that peculiar niche where lovers of both spy fiction and action fantasy are mutually satisfied with shameless appeals to their most banal interests. Only a media panderer could expect viewers to go along with yet another plot in which fearless agents foil an attempt to exterminate civilization while they also contend with the cautious, if not untrustworthy, bureaucracy that employs them. As expected, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt motivates his team (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Henry Cavill) to go beyond the dictates of their officials, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin. Problem is, this stock storyline has already been enhanced — vivified and deepened — in Luc Besson’s Transporter movies and Zack Snyder’s production of Suicide Squad. The standards of those films surpass the Mission: Impossible quasi-political, pseudo-kinetic brand. We may think we know all about Tom Cruise, including his religion, but do we know his politics? Is he just a super capitalist? Or is he merely a cagey pop star with a hit-and-miss record? He has turned the Mission: Impossible movie franchise into such a heartless machine (coproduced by the juvenile J. J. Abrams) that Fallout’s big, elaborate set-pieces conflate perpetual motion with religious ritual, and overstimulation comes across as the politics of a capitalist who fools himself — and his consumers — into thinking that violence is creativity,

It’s not a sign of good culture or good politics that there’s complete media consent on Fallout’s, relentless, can-you-top-this? action scenes, even praising Cruise’s risky, ping-pong ball existentialism. Eyes wide open, minds shut.

What does this installment’s doomsday plot say about our culture (obsessed with paramilitary and civilian violence) and our politics (obsessed with controlling government oversight)? The fawning media never bothers to ask Cruise whether his intentions are apolitical. Besides, the movies say more than he could explain or justify about peddling a globally addicting drug.

Conservative or liberal, we all should have a problem with Fallout’s pandering to our insensitivity — and confusing emotional numbness with cartoon aesthetics. The old James Bond movies used to open with spectacular stunt sequences that now are just regular fodder in the Mission: Impossible franchise. The director Christopher McQuarrie flaunts his perverse sadistic technique, spawn from the Tarantino principle that violence is cool. De Palma’s Mission: Impossible elevated generic TV into visually sumptuous and kinetic cinema 22 years ago. Why should we accept a film that is nothing more than action-movie diversion? McQuarrie’s hell-bent style even diverges from the ingenuity that distinguished the franchise’s best film, Ghost Protocol, which went beyond spy fiction to feature palpable pangs of love and revenge, especially as acted by former teammate Paula Patton, who infused the narrative with sensuality and a grieving woman’s passion. In Fallout, McQuarrie treats Hunt’s encounter with his wife (Michelle Monaghan) as no more than a footnote.

After Cruise worked with De Palma and Ghost Protocol’s Brad Bird, it’s alarming to see partnership with the much less talented McQuarrie on four films so far. When reviewing McQuarrie’s unpromising 2000 directorial debut The Way of the Gun, I had major qualms:

McQuarrie’s characters don’t represent any social anxiety, just the adolescent fantasy of fun violence. Ignoring the [story’s] sting of death and loss, McQuarrie has the temerity to treat it simply as thrill.

This venality is essentially all McQuarrie contributes to the Mission: Impossible franchise. It has become the basis of Cruise’s triumph over a vicious and vindictive industry and its media acolytes who hate him yet worship the money he can bring in.

All the Mission: Impossible films are too long, and none have the cultural essence of last year’s quasi-political Cruise epic American Made. Schlockmeister McQuarrie lacks the moral sense to make Fallout’s nonstop violence meaningful. Every fight and chase sequence ends with moral deflation, not the abstract, surrealist humor and magic of Buster Keaton or James Bond vintage. The film’s physical and emotional peak — featuring Cruise and Henry Cavill’s two-on-one brawl with a foreign agent (Liang Yang), which demolishes a gleaming white lavatory — fails to rouse the story’s issues or inspire reflection, even though Cavill’s hypermasculine jacket-toss and shoulder flex briefly startles the senses. An action scene is not outstanding if that’s all it is. Have we learned nothing from Eisenstein, Ford, Kurosawa, Peckinpah, Spielberg, Hill, Megaton, Bay, and the Chinese masters, who, lately, have been kicking Hollywood’s butt?

Each successive Mission: Impossible movie takes us further away from understanding the politics and morality of espionage. Cruise’s determination to conquer Hollywood through his own pyrrhic command of formula teaches a lesson that this sequel glides by. But it was articulated in last year’s Rogue Nation: “There are no allies in statecraft, just common interests.” That line sums up Fallout’s pop culture and political commitment.",RWM_Doc7_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Negative,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
137,RWM_Doc8_MissionImpossibleFallout,"Tom Cruise returns in the sixth instalment of the super-spy franchise. It’s full of high-octane action sequences, but is there anything more to it? PPicture the scene. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), the pride of the Impossible Missions Force, jumps out of a plane with his moustachioed CIA minder, Walker (Henry Cavill). After freefalling a few thousand feet, one of them is struck by lightning, and there is lots of mid-air hurly-burly with oxygen canisters and parachutes. The stunt work and filming are hugely impressive, and if the two hunky heroes were hurtling towards a villain’s hidden fortress or escaping from a flock of hang-gliding assassins, then the scene would be thrilling, too.

But they aren’t. What they’re doing is – wait for it – going to a disco in the centre of Paris. A disco. So was a parachute jump really the most surreptitious and practical way for our super spies to get there? Of course not, but Christopher McQuarrie, the film’s writer-director, must have realised that if Ethan had taken the Metro to the club there might have been a gap of more than five minutes between action sequences – and there was no way he was going to let that happen. Welcome to Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the sixth film in the series, and the second in a row to have been made by McQuarrie. His mission, and he certainly chose to accept it, was to make this instalment the most action-packed of them all, and so one adrenalised, elaborate set piece follows another, for a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours, whether there is any logic behind those set pieces or not. I suppose there is a plot threading them together, but I’m not sure what it is. It’s got something to do with three ‘plutonium cores’ which have been stolen by a band of terrorists called The Apostles. (They are essentially the same terrorists who were called The Syndicate in the previous film, but they’ve rebranded themselves and presumably updated their website accordingly.) To get the plutonium back, Ethan has to schmooze a fixer named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, ie, Princess Margaret from The Crown), a coolly mischievous femme fatale who deserved a lot more screen time than she gets, and who is no relation to Scarlett Johansson’s character in The Avengers.

As usual, Hunt is aided and abetted by his two adoring sidekicks, the nervous boffin Benji (Simon Pegg) and the less nervous boffin Luther (Ving Rhames), who provide some amusing odd-couple banter. But the CIA’s boss (Angela Bassett) has insisted that Walker tag along, much to the annoyance of Ethan’s own boss, Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Then there’s Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethan’s old MI6 flame, and Ethan’s wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and Solomon (Sean Harris), the rat-like baddie from the last film. But you’d need one of the IMF’s amazingly reliable tablets to keep track of who’s who, and whose side they’re all on.  

Basically, whenever they get together for a chat, the villains say that the heroes have fallen into a trap, and the heroes reply that, no, the villains have fallen into a trap, and then a villain pulls off a rubber mask to reveal that he is actually a hero, and then everyone agrees that it is time for a shoot-out. Starting off as a glamorously retro European espionage caper, with an undercurrent of doom and a grandiose reference to Homer’s The Odyssey, the film soon shoves aside coherent storytelling in favour of protracted fights and chases, as Ethan hops from Berlin to Paris to London to Kashmir, perpetually in search of things to climb up, run along, and jump off. It’s a brawn-over-brain affair. Whereas previous Missions were sometimes about being cleverer than the villains, this one is principally about being tougher and more determined. The main theme is that if you grit your teeth and stare so intently at your target that your eyes almost pop out of your skull, then you can somehow will yourself to victory – assuming, of course, you are as indestructible as Ethan. Although he isn’t officially a mutant or an alien, he can be thrown off a motorcycle at top speed, with no crash helmet on, and be fit as a fiddle a moment later.

This invulnerability can’t help but make Fallout less involving. If you were to judge the film according to the effort that has gone into planning and executing its increasingly spectacular and ludicrous action sequences, you could hail Mission: Impossible – Fallout as a masterpiece (as several critics have). Cruise does his own stunts, and his steely commitment to all the rope-swinging and rooftop-leaping is remarkable, especially bearing in mind that he is now 56, and must have been swigging from the fountain of youth between takes.

But if you judge the film according to how exciting those action sequences are, then Fallout falls short. However technically miraculous a helicopter dogfight or a multi-vehicle heist may be, it can’t really get the blood pumping or the sweat flowing if its tone isn’t consistent, and McQuarrie keeps wobbling between winking self-parody and apocalyptic seriousness. It can’t quite deliver, either, if it doesn’t have an interesting villain, or quotable dialogue, or a compelling narrative reason to happen – which brings us back to the aforementioned parachute jump. More importantly, the impact of these sequences is cushioned by having a hero who isn’t a human being.

Ethan’s buddies keep telling us what a good man Ethan is, and McQuarrie gives him some bad dreams to assure us that he has an inner life. But even after six films, it’s hard to warm to this invincible robot as much as you might warm to James Bond or Jason Bourne. Can you enjoy his knockabout adventures? Definitely. But can you care about them? Impossible.",RWM_Doc8_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Negative,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
138,RWM_Doc9_MissionImpossibleFallout,"In early 2016, swarms of movie fans turned on “Birdman” filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu and star Leonardo DiCaprio. The press was firebombing the internet with tales of how difficult the duo’s thriller “The Revenant” was to film, making it hard to avoid puffed up accounts of subzero temperatures, irate crew members, and a painfully bloated shooting schedule all in service of natural light and quote-unquote realism. The admittedly middle-of-the-road thriller won both men Oscars, but their reputations took a moderate hit. They’ve mostly stayed out of the spotlight since.
Jump to 2018 and some of those same film buffs can’t get enough of 55-year-old Tom Cruise’s ballyhooed derring-do on the set of “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” – how he broke his ankle (a shot that remains in the finished film), completed a HALO jump, learned to fly a helicopter, and on and on. True, Cruise’s insistence on doing his own stunts has been a boon to the series before, no more than when he unforgettably scaled Dubai’s Burj Khalifa skyscraper in 2011’s “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.”

But that film was light on its feet and seriously self-effacing. “Fallout” is mostly just serious, its distended running time trailing off into a masturbatory third act that flips the series script from witty fun to movie star fantasy camp. The audience is no longer the thing; it’s Cruise and Cruise alone.

Christopher McQuarrie is the series’ first filmmaker to be invited back (the original design was for each entry to have its own identity), taking advantage of that station by making a direct sequel to predecessor “Rogue Nation.” Unusually for the franchise, nearly the entire main cast of that film returns, including Sean Harris as slithery villain Solomon Lane. Only Jeremy Renner is absent, presumably due to Marvel Studios commitments, his character going unmentioned.

Cruise of course reprises IMF agent Ethan Hunt (the role he originated in Brian De Palma’s terrific “Mission: Impossible”), and his longtime right hand Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and left hand Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) are reliably along for the ride. Alec Baldwin is also back as Alan Hunley, Hunt’s reluctant boss, and Rebecca Ferguson returns as the ping-ponging MI6 operative Ilsa Faust. It’s a strong core made no stronger by the introduction and strained presence of Henry Cavill (“Justice League”) as August Walker, a CIA agent tasked with babysitting Hunt’s team.

As ordered by his boss Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), Walker is necessarily a narrative hanger-on – until he’s not, when McQuarrie takes the character in an awfully obvious direction. It’s agreeable seeing Cavill free from the constraints of Warner Bros.’ terrible take on Superman, but the 35-year-old actor seems genuinely unsure of how to govern his own charisma. As far as mysterious figures go, Solomon Lane is still a much more interesting one, Harris’ scraggly beard intriguingly belying his appearance in “Rogue Nation.” He remains a true wild card.

As Hunt and his team zig-zag across the globe in pursuit of three plutonium cores about to fall into the wrong hands, McQuarrie plays good soldier, indulging Cruise’s increasingly transparent attempts to burst out of the screen not just a fictional hero but a real-life one. Unlike Paul Greengrass’ Jason Bourne movies, McQuarrie’s action scenes are staged and photographed with much appreciated clarity, and the various car chases and fist fights get the adrenaline pumping. For a while.

After 90 minutes though, fatigue sets in. Where’s the wit? Where’s Hunt’s signature smirk? Nothing here is nearly as elegant as the opera sequence in “Rogue Nation,” nothing as nail-biting as its underwater setpiece. By the two-hour mark it’s perfectly clear where things are going and how they’ll get there. But “Fallout” has another half-hour in store, including a mind-numbingly mechanical helicopter chase that feels like it’s playing out in slo-mo. Memories of a relatively sharp first act are long gone, replaced by a movie star’s mid-life crisis unfolding right in front of us.

The endeavor ends up a professionally made if questionably scripted blockbuster with all the surface-level thrills a moviegoer could ask for. But the film, its final stretch in particular, is screaming out for something akin to the relatively cartoonish “Ghost Protocol.” Oh, to relive the fleetness of its Dean Martin-scored prison break sequence. Alas, it never comes, the series’ sixth entry posturing as a substantial actioner without ever being one. It is a Christopher Nolan-aping, overblown, underwritten thing, fated to slowly shrink in stature as the years go by.

Or maybe the novelty of Tom Cruise fantasy camp will prove eternal – a monument to senseless excess in an era destined to be known for it.",RWM_Doc9_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Negative,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
139,RWM_Doc10_MissionImpossibleFallout,"How much spectacle is too much? The question comes to mind often during the 147-minute sixth entry in the Mission: Impossible series, subtitled Fallout and starring, as ever, Xenu’s favorite son, Tom Cruise, as unflappable and mostly unbreakable I.M.F. (Impossible Missions Force) secret agent Ethan Hunt. Behind-the-scenes devotees will know that Cruise fractured his ankle while performing a between-buildings leap during the film’s production. Though it might have made more sense if he tore his Achilles’ tendon, given that writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, overseer of the prior Rogue Nation, begins this arduous blockbuster with the “mission…should you choose to accept it” tape hidden in a copy of Homer’s Odyssey.

“No man aforetime was more blessed, nor shall ever be hereafter” is how Odysseus, the wandering protagonist of that ancient Greek epic, describes Achilles, confined to the underworld after his fateful demise by arrow on the Trojan battlefield. Fallout follows through on at least the first part of Odysseus’s sentiment, missing no opportunity to prop up Cruise’s indomitable earthly ego while his character runs, jumps, falls, fist-fights, sky-dives, and clambers up rope and cliff in service of…what exactly?

McQuarrie’s screenplay posits Hunt as a selfless warrior who believes one innocent person killed is too many. It’s this staunch dogma that leads the secret agent, in Fallout’s pre-credits action sequence, to choose the life of loyal partner Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) over the suitcase of plutonium that a shadowy cabal of terrorists and their shadowier, Dr. Mabuse-like leader require for a nuclear attack on the holy cities of Rome, Jerusalem, and Mecca. At least, that’s the initial objective. The particulars of the big, bad master plan begin to shift after a certain cable news anchor makes a clever cameo and a false report. The outcome of this ruse sends the I.M.F. team, which also includes tech nerd Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and gruff, ostensibly by-the-book C.I.A. operative August Walker (Henry Cavill), on a nations-traversing expedition to keep the threatened mushroom clouds at bay.

Much of the film’s action, though, is confined to France and England, all the better to allow Cruise to drive the wrong way through traffic around the Arc de Triomphe or to ascend, monkey-like, the tower of the Tate Modern so he can strike a power pose against the London skyline. “I’ll figure it out” is Hunt’s oft-repeated mantra in the face of all the purportedly impossible odds. To which the members of his I.M.F. team can only throw up their arms and heave weary sighs as if submissively muttering under their collective breaths, “That’s our Ethan!” A little of this reverent compliance goes a very long way in Fallout, but it gets especially irritating in a late scene in which Stickell delivers a fawning monologue about how unimpeachably wonderful his partner is, as if any doubts to the contrary were equivalent to blasphemy.

Stickell is speaking, at that particular moment, to MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own parallel mission to I.M.F. involving the previous film’s villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Faust was an indelible foil for Hunt in Rogue Nation, with her sensuously steely demeanor and gravity-flouting legs of doom. Yet here she’s demoted to a neutered cheerleader for his—and, by extension, Cruise’s—reckless abandon. Yet unlike do-their-own-stunt exemplars such as Buster Keaton and Jackie Chan, there’s nothing generous or uplifting about Cruise’s jaw-dropping exploits. Beneath each potentially bone-crunching feat you sense desperation, a need to prove his physical and mental agility so as to keep doubt, a dimming star, and death at bay. It’s an unseemly display, and it’s why Cruise tends to work best in films like War of the Worlds and Eyes Wide Shut, where his vanity is utilized against him, where he exists primarily to be put through a torturous wringer, where he effectively becomes the unwitting butt of a seemingly infinite cosmic joke.

You catch a glimmer of that frailty in a close-quarters, bathroom-set fight scene in which Hunt and Walker face off against a roundhouse-kicking, karate-chopping antagonist (Liang Yang). Every time Cruise gets knocked to the floor or through a white-tiled wall, he stumbles to his feet and shoots a what-the-hell-am-I-doing? glance to the ether—or maybe the stunt coordinator. It’s the only time the actor betrays anything close to human fallibility, perhaps because the poker-faced Cavill, cocking his super-sized biceps like a pair of double-barreled shotguns, is a stilted cyborg by comparison.

As in Rogue Nation, Fallout’s action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous. There’s barely a second to breathe in between the HALO jumping, the motorcycle crashing, the helicopter ramming, and, in the tedious countdown-clock climax, the frenetic frame-toggling between widescreen 2.39 and IMAX 1.90 aspect ratios. (What Christopher Nolan hath wrought.) It would help if there was a single character worth caring about, though an unintended effect of reducing everyone on screen to a dewy-eyed Tom Cruise booster is that it no longer leaves poor Michelle Monaghan, returning as the incognito Mrs. Ethan Hunt, in the lone thankless role. The real fallout here is that everyone’s a zero.",RWM_Doc10_MissionImpossibleFallout,RWM,Action,Negative,Mission_Impossible_Fallout
140,BMI_Doc1_Hereditary,"Your enjoyment of “Hereditary” may depend on how many horror movies you’ve seen. If you haven’t seen a lot, most of it will shock the ever-loving bejesus out of you. If you have seen quite a few, you might get a kick out of counting all the bits that you’ve seen in other films from the genre. Or, if you’re a big horror movie fan, you might be confounded or even angry at those derivative bits being tossed in, along with one too many other ideas that end up seriously marring the last act. The film falls just short of greatness due to its wildly overplayed finale.
The shame of it is that “Hereditary” is quite terrific before it unravels. Assuredly written and directed by Ari Aster, the film is filled with dread rather than a high body count. The film’s production values are exemplary, particularly the deliberate camera work and subtle sound design. And it contains an intensely committed and affecting performance by lead Toni Collette, not to mention able support by her fellow cast members Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff, Ann Dowd and Milly Shapiro. 
Aster starts things off with an unsettling image that sets the tone for most of what’s to come. The camera slowly moves in on an elaborate and detailed dollhouse. It’s clearly hand-crafted art, and as we get closer, it focuses on one of the bedrooms. Then, quite eerily, the room seamlessly becomes real, with a teen boy waking from his bed. Is this a dream, a metaphor, or the film telling us that the line is going to be very thin between fantasy and reality? Yes, yes, and yes. And the movie only gets better from there.
We’re introduced to the occupants of the house, starting with dad Steve (Byrne). He’s a calm and stoic sort, gently nudging the self-absorbed teen boy Peter (Wolff) to get his clothes on for his grandma’s funeral. Younger sister Charlie (Shapiro) isn’t ready for the trip to church either. She’s an eccentric 13-year-old, sullen and morose. Then there is mother Annie (Colette), a woman so high-strung that she’s already sitting in the car ready to go to the church before her children have even awoken. 
At the funeral, this family’s dysfunction is exposed even more. Annie confesses to barely knowing the woman she’s eulogizing, and the bitter daughter indicates that she hasn’t forgiven her mother for the many years of estrangement. The mercurial mother kept many secrets from her daughter too, and Annie confesses to not knowing any of her mom’s friends who show up to mourn.
The more and more time we spend with the Grahams, the more we realize just how utterly secretive and strange they all are. Annie is always on edge, sleepwalking, and displaying wild mood swings day and night. Steve seems inert, even cowardly, in his abilities to calm her or control the wildly undisciplined household. Peter keeps to himself to a fault and lies about his affinity for drugs. And Charlie? Well, she’s the oddest of all. The girl chooses to remain aloof from all, locked in her own private world where she can talk to herself, make irritating noises with her tongue, and scribble ghastly portraits in her sketchbook. She has no friends and is the type of oddball who enjoys decapitating a dead bird and toting it around in her backpack.
Meanwhile, Annie’s fraught history with her deceased mom continues to stick in her craw to the point that she thinks she’s haunting her. It doesn’t help that the miniatures she makes are all of the oddest moments of her weird family life, including unseemly ones with her mother. Her mother exposing a breast to feed one of Annie’s babies, or the family watching Grandma wither away in the hospice are just two of the tableaus Annie has made for her upcoming gallery show. Charlie seems to have inherited a similar creepiness as she makes her own sinister sculpture art out of wires, wood, and that beheaded bird. The young girl also has visions of Grandma too. Indeed, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree in this family.

Then, a major character is beheaded in an automobile accident, and it throws the family into utter turmoil. Resentments build, relationships fray, and Annie turns towards spiritualism to help her grieve. She meets Joan (Ann Dowd, at her most unctuous) at a grief counseling session and is talked into performing a séance to contact her dead family member. Later, when Annie cajoles her family to join in yet another seance in the middle of the night, the film reaches its zenith of freakiness and unsettling terror. 
But then, as the third act kicks in, the story starts to wobble. The narrative becomes a lot more silly than scary, players zig and zag out of character, and bits are borrowed from other famous frighteners. Aster throws in tropes from “Rosemary’s Baby”, “The Fury”, “Firestarter”, “The Wicker Man”, “The Omen”, “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and “The Shining”, and the uniqueness of the film turns too derivative. It almost plays like fanboy homage rather than a cogent climax.
Did Aster doubt his script’s strengths and decide to give his final act a balls-to-the-wall finish to seem bigger and more commercial? Perhaps so, but that miscalculation robs what had been a unique effort up until the end. Seeing everything but the kitchen sink tossed into the ending while turning the Annie character into some sort of Freddy Kruger/Mrs. Baylock/Jack Torrance hybrid is not only disheartening, but it’s almost laughable.

Perhaps the hereditary in the title actually refers to all that Aster derived from those other movies for his third act, but he should have trusted his subtler instincts. His film could have been a modern classic, something on par with “Get Out” and “It Follows”, a shrewd and intellectual exercise in horror, but it falters at the finish line. Not only are the last 20 minutes desperate undisciplined, but the actions are screen don’t tingle the spine. They will cause you to scratch your head.",BMI_Doc1_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Negative,Hereditary
141,BMI_Doc2_Hereditary,"For as long as there have been movies, the marketing for films has always contained more than a hint of hyperbole. With the advent of cinema, audiences were promised sights and experiences they had never known before. Every film student has heard about how some viewers fled in terror when the Lumière Brothers screened their short film of a train arriving at the station. That word of mouth hucksterism has been a part of advertising for film ever since — made especially more noticeable when it comes to genre entries. Studios and filmmakers have often promised that their horror movies would be the scariest event ever witnessed by people. In the ballyhoo era of William Castle, the filmmaker would boast that people should sign away their rights if they got to frightened or had a heart attack. Even now, when RAW and other modern horror films come out, it’s usually accompanied by tales of attendees fainting or throwing up because the movie was just that terrifying. But something has started to transition in film culture, where the hyperbole has left the purview of the filmmakers and now become a large part of the discourse of critics.

With an abundance of sites and sources of film criticism and opinion, the pressure is on writers to make a mark and stand out. Such a skew in supply and demand threatens the possibility for subtlety and nuance. If a critic really enjoyed a film, despite some flaws, he now has to LOVE IT, proclaiming it a bold new direction for the medium. If a writer doesn’t like something despite some positive elements, she now has to HATE IT and talk about how terrible it is. Those middle ground opinions are fading away as everyone must be the most impassioned to make a dent. And that’s not to say that every critic heaping praise or scorn on a movie is disingenuous; but it is a rising concern within discussions about film where only the loudest and hottest of takes make a dent in people’s consciousness. As Assistant Editor Mike Vanderbilt likes to say, “hyperbole hurts horror.” Some writers, hoping to be quoted or retweeted or just make a splash, drum up new releases as the scariest thing ever (or since THE EXORCIST, which is apparently the benchmark); then, when audiences go and discover it’s not, or it’s not what they were expecting, bad word of mouth spreads about the film as expectations are missed and the experience isn’t what they had in mind. This isn’t a call for people to be less passionate in their writing, less effusive in their praise, or anything that genuinely reflects how they felt. But it is a strong suggestion that, when it comes to horror specifically, critics try to be more measured in their approaches.

 This is all a long way of saying that HEREDITARY arrived at SXSW 2018 as one of the most hyped films of the year. Coming off of an incredible reception at the Sundance Film Festival and a very enticing trailer, writer/director Ari Aster’s feature debut had everyone abuzz about how intense the film would be and led to hundreds trying to attend the midnight screening. Many people were turned away as they wished to be one of the earliest audiences to experience this bonafide phenomenon first hand. After the screening, listening to people discussing HEREDITARY, it clearly struck a real chord and many found it incredibly compelling and eminently horrific. The tweets and reviews came out proclaiming it the scariest movie in a long time and that audiences will be terrified. It’s weird to be surrounded by that much praise and see people affected so much, and to simply feel that the film… is fine. Perhaps it’s a case of heightened expectations, or maybe it simply didn’t connect, but HEREDITARY is a mostly well-made film featuring strong performances, excellent cinematography, and a clever concept. It relies a lot on sound scares to startle audience, and the plot quickly unravels into a mess once viewers start pulling at the threads; which ultimately makes it hard to scare or stay with audiences after the credits have rolled.

 

Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is laying her mother, Ellen, to rest. A private woman with secrets and emotional issues, Ellen’s death has vastly impacted Annie and her family. Her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), is trying to be supportive as his wife tackles yet another family loss. Annie’s daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) is grappling with mortality and the loss of a matriarch who truly cared for her. Meanwhile, Peter (Alex Wolff), Annie’s eldest, is weirded out by the events but is simply trying to be as normal as possible in high school. Annie learns more about her mother, and struggles greatly with being the only one left alive in her immediate family, when a horrible tragedy strikes the Grahams. As grief spirals into resentment, and the sinister beliefs of Ellen become uncovered, the Grahams try their best to navigate unexpected waters that threatens to tear them all apart.

HEREDITARY is a great concept for a horror film. The idea of the sins of parents being revisited upon their descendants is nothing new — it’s literally the plot of a ton of ancient Greek tragedies — but to make those echoing issues reverberate using the genre’s trappings is a clever conceit that opens up for a lot of exploration. The entire cast is excellent as they show the way that grief infects and how it can turn into something more and something worse. Writer/director Aster shows a deft hand at constructing this story and conjures up some lasting imagery that, even without context, may produce an emotional reaction. The issues with the film are twofold in its execution in the micro and some of the themes in macro.


In terms of executing, it is blocked and shot well, with Aster giving a very strong sense of place and surroundings. The color palette makes it all seem dour but also benign in that pastoral way, suggesting that all is not well beneath the surface. HEREDITARY is a slow burn though, building up odd incidents and creepy moments before an explosive finale. The problem lies in that it repeatedly uses orchestral stings and other loud noises to induce a sense of startling, rather than simply letting the tension mount until it boils over. These jump scares feel like a need to reinforce to audiences that they should be scared, rather than simply trusting them to give in to the narrative. But, given the ultimate reveal of the film, perhaps that’s not a good plan either. Because, while films don’t have to be a straight line from Point A to Point B to be good, there are a lot of convoluted steps that need to be taken once the truth is revealed. Like Luthor’s plan in BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE, or Zemo’s scheme in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, the machinations at work need a lot of intermediary and random steps that really don’t make sense and are part of the plot as an excuse for another creepy image or sequence.

 

The macro issue is one of themes. It appears for a while that the movie is interested in exploring the hereditary angle of mental health. How what people inherit from their family isn’t just external values or customs, but also an internal legacy of psychosis and neurosis that lingers far past when they are gone. That’s a very intriguing angle to take, and works well within the confines of Aster’s concept. But in execution, the mental health angle is either dropped or married to an occult element; meaning that those with mental illness are quite literally demonized in the plot. That’s a very muddled message and HEREDITARY seems to want to take on a weighty subject matter, but then ultimately has nothing to say about it.

It’s always a weird phenomenon when likeminded people love something, but one finds oneself not feeling the same. Concerns of being a curmudgeon or a stick in the mud, or maybe just not “getting it,” creep in. The critics that are heaping praise on HEREDITARY are most likely genuine and truly found themselves scared by Aster’s film. And while there are a lot of good elements contained within it, and there are effective scenes and sequences throughout, the movie never comes together as a whole to be truly unnerving. The comparisons with much more powerful films or boasts of how scary HEREDITARY is do it a real disservice. Those expecting a film that will haunt viewers for many nights afterward may be disappointed when instead they find a slow burn with an over-the-top ending. Hobbled by a lack of cohesive narrative execution, Aster has ultimately made a very strong debut that shows a great talent for filmmaking, but  one that would do with some refinement on the script level.",BMI_Doc2_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Negative,Hereditary
142,BMI_Doc3_Hereditary,"A strange bird, ""Hereditary"" is. This shrill and unhappy supernatural drama starts off as a sort of psychological character study and ends up in the wild hinterland of sulfur and vile spirits.
Much the same, I suppose, could be said of The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby, to which Hereditary has duly been likened, but the more useful comparison might be to Darren Aronofsky’s genre-smashing, audience-polarizing mother! I deeply admired that film’s art and intensity while admitting I didn’t have a great time at it — not all art is meant to be entertaining. Is Hereditary another case of a wooly bully of cinematic expression, destined to dazzle the elites while displeasing the mundanes?

In this case, I have to stand with the mundanes. Director Ari Aster, making his feature debut, wants to bowl us over with Hereditary. He reaches into a big dusty box and hauls out every trick he can find — there’s one embarrassingly “look, Ma, I’m a director” shot that puts a character upside down in the frame as she runs, and then the camera follows her and rights itself. It’s a disorienting shot, and it calls attention to itself needlessly, as so much else does in the film. I could go spelunking thematically and justify the narrative quirks, but I don’t want to. It’s an effectively made bad movie. It plays fast and loose with logical expectations, but not in a way that especially illuminates anything other than its own facile twists.

For the longest time, the movie seems to be about Annie Graham (Toni Collette), an artist whose mother has recently died. Annie had and has a fraught, complicated relationship with her mother, and she’s well on her way to raising two neurotic kids, the brooding stoner Peter (Alex Wolff) and the morbid Charlie (Milly Shapiro), even though her husband and their father Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is usually a soothing source of calm. The movie starts to seem as though it’s concerned with the derangement of grief and trauma, especially when Annie meets a fellow in bereavement, Joanie (Ann Dowd), who teaches her how to contact the dead.

There’s more than a hint of “The Monkey’s Paw” here, and Pet Sematary and all the other spooky pop culture that advises us not to mess with the occult: “Sometimes dead is better.” Eventually, as the omens and freaky scares add up, it becomes clear that this is all the movie is going to be about; and yet it touches on annihilating despair, and asks its cast (particularly Collette, but also young Alex Wolff) to lower themselves into an emotional meat grinder in a way that the film, I say, does not earn. I did not need to see a sad body part seething with ants on the side of a godforsaken road in the morning light, and I came to resent Hereditary and Ari Aster for making me look at it for no reason other than effect. Speaking of effects, there are a few scenes featuring the fakest-looking swarm of flies I’ve ever seen in a movie. Another scene involving a screaming character engulfed in flames is just high-pitched stupidity, as is another scene in which someone flips out in a classroom.

I called Hereditary effective, which it is; an incident at about the half-hour mark pulled a loud gasp out of me, and not only because the hopes we’d placed in an intriguing character were suddenly cut off. Ari Aster has some chops, but he uses them to make us feel, well, bad — on edge, more irritated than frightened. At two hours and seven minutes, the movie dawdles at a few points, including an early shot that tracks into one of Annie’s impossibly detailed miniature houses until it comes to a stop in Peter’s bedroom — his real bedroom. Is Annie’s art relevant to the movie thematically or narratively? No, it’s meaningless, and so is she. Pretty much anything we came close to caring about in the film is thrown away for the insipid climax, during which a character opens her mouth and cheese falls out — “Give us your knowledge of all secret things. Bring us honor, wealth, and good familiars.” At which point the viewer is either rapturous at having been so bamboozled or heading for the sweet release of the exit.

143,BMI_Doc4_Hereditary,"There’s a new kid on the horror block aiming to take up space in your homes and your mind called Hereditary. The film directed by Ari Aster, about a family in grief, is a tense picture, but one I found ultimately unfulfilling.

Director Ari Aster is certainly a master of mood and dread and it is definitely one of the most confident horror movies you will see. Aster has such a command of the frame and how his actors exist within it that this is a rare horror film that doesn’t have many jump scares. Don’t take this to mean you won’t jump at something scary (the visuals here are WILD) but the movie is not built around those moments that make you leave your seat. And that’s the right approach to take because it allows the actors to shine. One of the best things about horror movies is that they really allow us to dig into primal human instincts in the way other films can’t. By putting the ordinary up against the extraordinary, humanity’s core essence can be revealed, and it’s revealed here by some great actors, led by the incomparable Toni Collette and the shockingly great Alex Wolff. Collette is no stranger to delivering great performances in horror films having been nominated for The Sixth Sense. She adds to her legend with a really ground, yet incredibly hysterical performance. She is going for it in every scene but still finds the core emotions of her character. Wolff, whom I didn’t like in Jumanji 2, is brilliant here as the son wracked with guilt and terror about his mother and what he’s done. He easily could have made this character unsympathetic but instead reminds us that even though he’s in high school, he’s still a traumatized kid.

So how come after leaving this movie the question is not how did they accomplish that, but rather what exactly is the movie confident about? This is a question I’m still wrestling with given the sheer amount of concepts and themes the movie broaches. To be honest, I feel this was a case of a movie setting up expectations and not necessarily sticking the landing it appeared to be. Hereditary doesn’t give a fuck about your expectations (probably why it got that D+ CinemaScore) but it should have cared more about the substance it was digging into. This movie covers everything from grief to mental illness to cults and demons in a way that seems to go against itself at times. This movie is definitely a slow burn, but did it really build up to that ending? And why did it feel like it took us forever to get there?

Hereditary is like the more volatile soul sibling of The Witch and The Babbadook. Those movies dealt with many of the topics broached in Hereditary but had a much clearer focus and drive. Hereditary starts with the death of a grandmother and by the 30-40 minute mark levels us with another death, that of the daughter Charly, in a horrific accident caused by the son Peter. In between however, it introduces, via Annie’s moving monologue in a grief support group, underlying familial issues with mental illness. It’s a really interesting set of layers to build on for a film, and for the most part it’s exactly where I thought the movie was going. I loved pontificating well into the run time of the film whether or not we were just watching a family come apart from the seams via hereditary mental illness. Toni and Alex do a complicated dance regarding these topics akin to the high wire work of Essie Davis in The Babbadook. The end of the 2nd act and beginning of the 3rd are some of the best parts of a movie I’ve experienced in a long time.

However, by the end of the movie Hereditary has decided to move in a different direction, raising a demon to possess the body of Peter. It’s a shocking move, but unlike The Witch, which had a similar shock turn, doesn’t feel as gratifying. Why is that? All the clues of the cult and the demons were laid out in Hereditary but Aster cannot make them come together because they feel so out of place. It’s like he traded a hard to read movie and replaced it with a movie about a topic that he intentionally obfuscates until the last 15 minutes. The conclusion isn’t even gratifying on a storytelling level because it shifts the narrative to focus on the least interesting character (not the least interesting actor though). It’s kind of frustrating really because I believe the movie is well composed, it just can’t stick the landing.

144,BMI_Doc5_Hereditary,"Hereditary is the horror film that has been described as a ‘ride of pure terror’ and likened to The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby and The Shining, to which I can say only: in its dreams. Given I’m such a wuss when it comes to anything frightening — the child-catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still scares the living daylights out of me — I’m rather thankful, but I’m perplexed as to why it received such rave reviews. Ride of pure terror? I’ve had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair. I saw it at the paying cinema with my adult son and his girlfriend, who were also bored out of their minds and could only conclude that ‘all other critics are idiots’. This is as I’ve long suspected, but it’s useful to have it confirmed.
Written and directed by Ari Aster, Hereditary stars an overwrought Toni Collette as Annie, whose mother, Ellen, has just died. Annie had a difficult relationship with Ellen and I initially thought the scene was being set for a horror spin on ambivalent motherhood, which could have been interesting, but I was wrong. Unlike, for example, Get Out, which was clever and made a point, this never felt anything other than pointless. Stuff certainly happens after Ellen’s death. Symbols and signs appear. A book on spiritualism is discovered. Ellen’s grave is desecrated. But they occur flatly, as if being ticked off some shopping list.
Ride of pure terror? I've had more terrifying rides on the teacups at the fair
The film is packed with tropes and clichés: a house in the woods, dead birds, a locked room, a creepy attic. These are knowing but there are others that, one suspects, aren’t knowing at all, and feed into one particular old chestnut: men are calmly sane while women are always hysterical. So Annie is the hysterical one, as is her 13-year-old daughter (Milly Shapiro), who goes all spooky and starts making clucking sounds. She also has an older son, Peter (Alex Wolff), who is not similarly afflicted — he’s a typical weed-smoking teenage slacker — while their father, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), has no role to play beyond telling Annie to get a grip. Poor Steve and poor Peter, though, who don’t come out of it well. But that’s what happens, one must suppose, if you throw in your lot withcrazy ladies.
It isn’t much of a reveal — it’s one minute of literal exposition right at the end — and it’s not much of a build-up to that reveal, as the pacing is so poor. There are decapitated heads and incinerations and rotting corpses but it’s never dramatic or exciting, and at the viewing I attended the audience laughed at the parts that were intended as the most terrifying, as it’s all so silly. Plus there are plot holes aplenty, as well as psychological ones. Annie wonders why Peter is so stand-offish with her. I don’t know, but might the fact that he once woke up in the middle of the night to find she’d doused him in petrol and was about to set fire to him have something do with it? Might it? One last thing, and I’ll be vague here, to avoid spoiler accusations, but to those who have already seen this: why did the power have to be transferred to a male form? Why wasn’t a girl good enough?
Your better bet is The Happy Prince, Rupert Everett’s passion project about Oscar Wilde’s last, wretched years. No,I didn’t much wish to see Wilde being driven to his death either, but while the film is sad, it is ravishingly sad, and I just love Everett, who’s said so often that his career is over that he’s kind of made a career out of it. Respect.
Everett wrote, directed, produced and stars as Wilde who, at the point that the story is taken up, has just been released from prison for gross indecency. Shunned by British society, he is forced into exile in France and Italy but, even so, he’s cornered in a church one day by a group of Hoorah Henrys out for his blood, and it is so sad, but ravishingly sad, with the light in the church pouring in like melted butter.
Using vignettes and flashback, we learn about his few loyal friends, his relationship with his wife and sons, which was devoted if impossible, and how he allowed Bosie to continue to destroy him. This occasionally slips into cheap sentiment, but there are some stand-out scenes — Wilde singing ‘The Boy I Love Is Up In The Gallery’, for instance — and, of course, there are some terrific lines. ‘I am dying beyond my means,’ he will complain on his deathbed. As for Everett, he is terrific. His Wilde is not hagiographic. His Wilde is brilliant but also foolhardy, exploited but also wilfully self-destructive, funny but also pathetic. A sad film, but ravishingly so.",BMI_Doc5_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Negative,Hereditary
145,BMI_Doc6_Hereditary,"Ari Aster’s absurdly accomplished debut is the best horror movie of the year so far. You could make a good argument for it being the best horror movie of the decade. But it won’t be for everybody, because of the expectation that word – horror – creates.
It puts you in a certain frame of mind. You prepare to be launched out of your seat with shock, to scream, to giggle at yourself for being so scared of something so obviously unthreatening. Hereditary isn’t that movie. You may well scream and try to vacate your seat, but there is no time for a comforting giggle, because Hereditary doesn’t move with the rhythms of most horror movies. It doesn’t jostle you up and down, through moments of fear and relief, or ever try to make you laugh. It takes you in its cold, clammy hand and drags you further and further into despair and alarm, until the credits roll. Then it leaves you there to steep in the terrors you’ve just felt.
You’ll probably notice we’re not saying much about plot. Deliberately so, because the less you know the better. The focus is a family that has recently lost its matriarch, an unpleasant, secretive woman, by all accounts. Her daughter, Annie (Toni Collette), feels a mix of grief and release. Annie’s children, Charlie (Milly Shapiro) and Peter (Alex Wolff), and her husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), move around her with caution. The unsaid hangs like heavy clouds around the whole family. They don’t know in the film’s first half hour, when they bicker and sulk and brood, that they’ll never feel this happy again.
Aster, barely into his 30s, has made a film that has echoes of Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining and Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby (a big influence on Aster) in the way that it makes home, which should be the safest of places, feel alien and threatening. He directs in long, slow takes in which you can feel something horrible might happen. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t, but that itchy feeling of uncertain menace is what makes it so exhausting to watch. A fraught family dinner can be every bit as frightening as a ghostly apparition advancing from a dark corner. Aster builds his story’s intensity with expert control, culminating in a storm of nightmare moments that come so fast that the instinct to breathe might temporarily leave you. The horrible images he burns on your eyes will not.
Collette, an actress who has never managed a bad performance in her life, is at career-best level. The film’s weight is all on her shoulders and we see how it makes her buckle and hurt. Annie is dragged through an emotional hell and everything she’s feeling shudders out of Collette in exhausted silences and primal screams. A good measure of whether you’ll like this movie might be how much you enjoyed the very broadly similar 2014 movie The Babadook. Both films are as much about soul-deep sadness and loneliness as they are about scaring you stiff. If that left you unmoved, this may well too. In a way, those who don’t like it are the lucky ones. For those of us caught in its spell, its bleakest scenes could be haunting us for decades to come.",BMI_Doc6_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
146,BMI_Doc7_Hereditary,"On June 8, A24 released Hereditary, a Sundance competitor from Ari Aster. The much-hyped horror feature has already recouped over three times its $10 million budget and marked the highest-grossing opening of any A24 film. This is a staggering debut given Hereditary’s narrative: The film’s plot gets rolling following a grisly child death, and its experimental, Satan-worshipping story, though compelling, can be difficult to follow. Critics are divided as to what Hereditary is even about—is it a straightforward paranormal tale or an allegory for familial mental illness? The film is somewhat at odds with itself. As its melodramatic first half leads to a ghoulish denouement, it can feel like Hereditary is unsure of its own genre, but it is consistently wrenching, as the family in the film collapses under the weight of their shared suffering.
Hereditary does not just depict a family undone by mental illness—its subjects ultimately fall victim to their shared inability to speak about emotional trauma. Hereditary kicks off with a funeral: The estranged mother of Annie Graham (Toni Collette) has died, and Annie is stumbling her way through a eulogy that describes the deceased matriarch as a woman with “private rituals, private friends, private anxieties.” The eulogy makes clear that her mother’s apparent chilliness and secretive nature was part of the rift between them, and Annie is determined not to repeat history with her 13-year-old daughter, Charlie (Milly Shapiro). The night of the funeral, she encourages Charlie—who she notes never even cried as a baby—to allow herself catharsis. Similarly, Annie’s husband, Steve (Gabriel Byrne), asks their teenage son, Peter (Alex Wolff), if he’d like to talk about the difficult day.
The children answer their parents with silence and a shrug, respectively—the film’s first warning that, despite their parents’ efforts, it might be too late for the kids to find their emotional voices. Indeed, Annie and Steve consistently model repression, internalizing everything from spooky night visions to grave desecration. Annie lies to Steve about attending a grief support group where, although she shares, her monologue is couched in sarcasm. “I have a lot of resistance to things like this,” she explains to the group before saying her mother’s death “wasn’t a huge blow.” Familial backstory revealed in that same speech sheds light on Annie’s trauma: A psychotically depressed father who starved himself to death and a schizophrenic brother who hanged himself preceded her mother’s death, whose preexisting dissociative identity disorder worsened before she died of natural causes.
Annie rattles off that history like a grocery list, only occasionally wavering. “I just don’t want to put any more stress on my family,” she admits at the end. “I’m not even sure that they could give me that support.” The film puts that hypothesis to a gut-wrenching test when, after a series of harrowing mistakes, Charlie is killed in a freak accident. Where the death of Annie’s mother was uneasy for the family, Charlie’s death shatters it, with Peter and Annie particularly immersed in guilt and sorrow. A few outbursts aside, their family history of internalizing tragedy prevails: Though Peter witnesses Charlie’s death, he stomachs it silently, leaving Annie to discover her daughter’s body; Annie’s own unbridled grief quickly gives way to numbness. She and Steve both muffle their emotions with pills, while Peter has to steel himself, fists clenched, before he can walk through his own front door. And though he’s ill-equipped to deal with his increasingly haunted wife and son, Steve does hint at Annie’s history of mental illness in a message to her former psychiatrist (“I’m worried that Annie may be on the verge of, or in the MIDDLE of…”), but with his note unfinished, viewers are left to try and fill in the blanks of Annie’s past themselves.
The literal destruction of their grieving family unfolds with dreadful inevitability, as both Annie and Peter ultimately die by their own hands. Their deaths, despite paranormal influences, can be interpreted as suicide, in light of the film’s overt references to mental illness. Despite ever-evolving diagnoses and new forms of therapy, the stigmatization of mental illness in our society is alive and well. Though Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain’s tragic deaths recently brought suicide back into the national conversation and, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, suicide is the 10th most common cause of death in America, the subject—when not being glorified or sensationalized in shows like 13 Reasons Why—is still taboo. As Kat Kinsman, who in the wake of Bourdain’s death wrote about the food industry’s culture of stoicism for Food and Wine, put it: “…You either have to deal with the slightly uncomfortable situation of having your line cook cry in front of you, or you cry at their funeral.”
Across all classes and all industries, we have engendered a society that’s so uncomfortable with negative emotion and that so stigmatizes mental illness that some of us would literally rather die than reveal that we don’t know how to navigate our pain. Though gently helpful reminders about crisis lines and sliding-scale therapists follow high-profile suicides, survivors often push back against the idea that the burden of reaching out for help should lie solely on depressed people. As Mark Rowland wrote for the UK’s Mental Health Foundation, we “need to cultivate a culture where it’s okay to not be okay.” We know logically that emotional repression can augment sufferer’s mental health difficulties, leading them to experience social isolation, increased aggression, and possibly even early death. And even though Hereditary is, explicitly, a horror film, it’s particularly jarring to see such a realistic progression play out for its characters, who swallow their grief until it overtakes them.
Ari Aster couldn’t have predicted that Hereditary would be released at a cultural moment in which suicide looms so large, but he has asserted in interviews that he “wanted to make a very serious meditation on grief and trauma and the corrosive effect that trauma can have on the family unit” and that “as I was pitching [the film], I was describing it as a family tragedy that curdles into a nightmare.” Regardless, the film’s chilling lesson is timely: When we cultivate societies, families, and institutions that encourage the suppression of messy emotions, our lives become terrifying even before any gory visions and demonic possessions enter into them. In the end, despite all its spooky marketing, Hereditary is a fable about generational silence in the face of mental illness, where the moral of the story is so dark and visceral that audiences feel compelled to look away.",BMI_Doc7_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
147,BMI_Doc8_Hereditary,"Much more than just a horror movie, Hereditary is an emotional experience designed to upset and traumatize. Brutal and beautiful, first-time feature director Ari Aster crafts a harrowing tale that is as engrossing as it is difficult to watch. Aided by haunting direction and cinematography, along with a bravura performances from Toni Collette and Alex Wolff, Hereditary is a pitch black exploration of family dynamics and the fallout of dark supernatural secrets. Mild spoilers ahead...

Hereditary is one of the rare films with a vast disparity between critic reviews and public opinion. Although Ari Aster’s first full-length feature sits comfortably with an admirable 90% Rotten Tomatoes score, its D+ Cinemascore, which gauges audience reactions upon leaving the theater, tells a different story. This discrepancy usually results from one of two possibilities: a truly awful film, or in the case of Hereditary, a film that is so different from the one marketed, that the audience leaves the theater feeling cheated. 

At first glance, Hereditary has the trappings of your typical horror film. With a troubled family, an odd and creepy child, and seances with the dead, you’d be forgiven for expecting easy scares from a standard supernatural thriller, especially with trailers and marketing material touting it as “the scariest film since The Exorcist.” However, there is nothing ""easy"" about Hereditary, and those entering the theater looking for cheap jump-scares and light popcorn fare will be sorely disappointed. That’s not to say Hereditary isn’t frightening - it’s downright horrifying, but in a way that defies expectation. A dark meditation on how you can never really know those closest to you and the dark secrets that families will bury, Hereditary will stay with you long after you leave the cinemas, and not always in a pleasant way.

The film follows the harrowing disintegration of the Graham family, and opens up with family woman Annie (a phenomenal Toni Collette) giving the eulogy at her mother’s funeral. Afterwards, she attends a local grief counseling group not out of mourning, but out of confusion as to how to respond to the difficult woman’s passing. It’s at this support group that Annie recounts her frigid relationship with her mother, as well as an awful family history that is strewn with tragedy. Her mother’s death has also strained her relationships at home, where a passive husband (Gabriel Byrne), stoner son (Alex Wolff, in the film’s other breakout performance), and oddly withdrawn daughter (Milly Shapiro, Broadway’s Matilda) await her. Annie’s work, where she dutifully creates detailed dioramas for her clients, begins to suffer as well - distracted and unfocused, she starts crafting disturbed vignettes from her own life in miniature (an inspired and creative storytelling device that Aster uses quite effectively). I won’t go much further into the plot, but it’s here that Aster’s meta-aware script prepares you for a slow descent into madness, only to completely upend the narrative with a turn so darkly grotesque and disturbing that it has on more than one occasion led audience members to walk out of the theater right in the middle of the film, as was the case at my screening.

Hereditary then, in its misery-laden denouement, becomes a fascinating cinematic paradox - a film that is hauntingly difficult to watch, but also utterly engrossing and captivating sheerly based on the strength of its cast. Toni Collette puts forth career-best work as Annie Graham, and you’ll be equal parts horrified and astonished at how expressive her emoting can be, with her twisting face and bone-chilling wails of grief and terror. Collette is a force of nature in Hereditary, and delivers a performance that will go down in history as a horror-movie benchmark for years to come. And while a lot of praise has been rightfully heaped upon Collette, one cannot overlook the work of Alex Wolff (Patriot's Day, My Friend Dahmer) as the family's stoner teen Peter Graham. Wolff more than holds his own opposite Collette, but in a different way. While Collette wears her reactions on her face, Wolff's equally memorable performance is more internalized - shock, grief, and terror, realistically bubbling just underneath perpetually teary eyes. It’s also impossible to talk about Hereditary without a mention of Milly Shapiro’s Charlie, the resident creepy child that owns some the film’s most chilling moments. It’s a far cry from her playful role as Matilda on Broadway, with her clucking tic and a gruesome doll-making hobby reminiscent of Sid from Toy Story. This brings us to Gabriel Byrne, who plays family patriarch Steve, who unfortunately is a little shortchanged as the family’s voice of reason and skepticism. It’s a passive and sleepy role that is, frankly, undercooked and never lives up to the talents of Byrne, a talented stage and screen actor.

With cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski behind the lens, Hereditary also benefits from beautiful and inventive camerawork. Sweeping shots of the Graham estate evoke elegance as well as menace, with dark corners and hallways oozing with sinister intent; surreal zooms into Annie's dioramas that slowly turn into a real room with real people; these are just some of the tricks employed to toy with your perception. Another impressive feat is the film's nuanced scares that take place in the dark recesses of the Graham residence. While many other films will make hauntings jolting and obvious, Hereditary on more than one occasion makes its apparitions barely perceptible - subtle shapes in pitch black rooms that make you question what you're seeing - which renders its quieter scares that much more effective. 

First-time feature director Ari Aster is already being touted as a new ""master of horror,"" but the strengths of the movie stretch beyond the simple tropes of modern fright. A true ""horror"" film, Hereditary is the next step in the evolution of the genre, dealing in deep-rooted fear and despair that lingers long after you leave the theater. While modern gore tends to lean heavily into gonzo sensationalism for the sake of shock, Hereditary’s harder-to-stomach scenes have a purpose, leaving indelible impacts on the film’s plot and the viewers’ psyches. Even though there is some searingly grotesque imagery that even the likes of Eli Roth or Takeshi Miike wouldn’t touch, it doesn’t feel half as exploitative, and will leave you pondering much more than a dangling eyeball or severed limb ever would. Just don’t do any of that thinking at night.",BMI_Doc8_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
148,BMI_Doc9_Hereditary,"You know those nightmares that are so traumatizing and vivid they fuck up your whole day? That's Hereditary. This feature directorial debut from Ari Aster made a big splash at Sundance, and it's easy to see why: Hereditary avoids cheap shock-and-awe scare tactics almost entirely, instead building up a bone-chilling tension that's relatable and frighteningly realistic.
 
The story begins with Annie (Toni Collette), an artist specializing in miniature models, who is dealing with conflicted feelings of grief following the death of her estranged mother. Her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) is quietly supportive, their son Peter (Alex Wolff) is a moody stoner and their daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) does creepy shit like cutting the head off a dead bird. Typical family stuff.

The first half highlights the pain that stems from complicated familial relationships, with much of the tension coming from score composer (and noted Canadian saxophonist) Colin Stetson's dissonant drones, and the eerie dioramas that artist Annie builds in her workshop. Her dollhouse-like models are peppered around the family's rustic home, and these metaphor-filled dioramas grow increasingly sinister as the tragic events build up and we learn more about the family's dark past.

Yes, there are horrors, but they're often played for emotional impact rather than gratuitous scares, and the film works so well as a haunting drama that it's possible to temporarily forget that this is even a horror movie. The most upsetting moment of the entire movie isn't a scary scene — it's one where a character is overcome with heartbreaking, entirely believable grief.

The patient pacing and Collette's tragic performance mean that, by the time the plot takes a supernatural turn, it's all the more terrifying. What's scariest about Hereditary is the way it blurs the line between psychological trauma and demonic possession — family members stop trusting one another as reality becomes increasingly difficult to pin down. Aster's warping of reality is so effective that a simple trick like upside-down camera work or a quick cut from nighttime to daytime becomes deeply unsettling.
 
This isn't the kind of popcorn horror flick that's full of jump-scares and spooky good times. Rather, this is a film that friends will dare one another to watch and then regret it instantly, and it takes a certain masochistic streak to enjoy. But if you don't mind frightening yourself to the core, Hereditary is a harrowing masterpiece.",BMI_Doc9_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
149,BMI_Doc10_Hereditary,"It’s a slow-burn horror film of the third degree. And it deserves a place in your nightmares (as morbid as that sounds).
Ari Aster makes his feature debut with Hereditary, and he enters the horror genre like a seasoned pro. His greatest strengths in storytelling also make his film incredibly difficult to watch.
The story Aster spins features Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense) at her most raw. She plays Annie Graham (a nod to the word anagram, maybe?), an artist specializing in miniatures who scarcely survived a traumatic childhood. Her father was psychotically depressed, her brother has schizoid personality disorder, and her mother’s darkest secrets set this film in motion.
At the film’s start, Annie’s mother has just died, leaving lots of unanswered questions.
The upheaval also leaves the deceased’s dearest granddaughter, young Charlie (Milly Shapiro), with bizarre visions of her deceased grandmother smiling (heebie jeebies on high alert).
Charlie, like her mother Annie, is unsatisfied with the space she’s allotted in life. She prefers to sleep in a treehouse in front of her house to her bedroom.
And the peculiarity doesn’t stop there: When a bird flies mysteriously into a window at her school, Charlie finds it outside during playtime and serenely cuts off its head with a pair of scissors like it’s a missing piece for an art project she’s cooking up — undoubtedly the spark that causes Hereditary to burn with madness.
“I used to be obsessed with horror films. I’m not so much anymore, but growing up, there were a few films that traumatized me as a kid,” Aster said when discussing what inspired him to conjure up his fiendish horror film. “There was Roman Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby and Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now, and as many Japanese horror films and dramas. But [Peter Greenaway’s 1989 film The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover] is a pretty evil movie. That film is filled with images that really bothered me and stayed with me.”
Aster’s film is no different. It’s one of those rare horror films that takes its time to build its characters and immerse you in their world, to the point where you feel as though you also inherited the family’s dilemmas. So when terrible things begin to happen and unsettling images hit the screen, you feel their pain and shout at what may be lurking in the shadows.
 “A big part of it was not just what the images are, but the artifice of the filmmaking. There is something upsetting about artifice. [Greenaway] is somebody who uses all these alienating devices, and yet the imagery is very immediate and upsetting, and also it was one of the first films that I’ve ever seen that felt like it was made by an authentic misanthrope, like somebody who really hated people. I know I want to produce that same effect,” Aster joked (but maybe not). “So I was thinking about [Greenaway] a lot when it came to the more upsetting imagery in this film.”
Two sequences in particular stand out as deeply upsetting. One scene uses a key plot point to pivot the trajectory of the story from a troubled brew to a deranged animal on the hunt.
The other involves Annie’s son Peter (a terrific Alex Wolff of My Friend Dahmer) uncontrollably, and violently, slamming his head against his school desk. Once you bear witness to the hard-boiled moment, you may wonder how something could ever feel so bleak.
“We had a desk that was made of rubber, but if it’s repeatedly slamming your head, it hurts a lot. I didn’t anticipate that,” Wolff recalled. “I think it’s fair to say I don’t really like to fake doing anything, ever. I think it’s also fair to say I didn’t fake anything in this movie. So if the scene required me to slam my head against a desk, that’s just what we did to pull off that real feeling.”
For the actors, especially Collette and Shapiro, one cannot imagine the dark places they had to go to tap into the disturbed world Aster creates, and furthermore, how they were able to shake what cannot be unseen. The last 20 minutes alone, when all of what has been bottled up comes screaming out, are unyielding. It’s just one scene straight from the depths of hell to the next.
“Oddly, [the film] didn’t really affect me that much,” the 15-year-old Shapiro said. “I used a method where you can create a character for film or stage [Shapiro is a Tony Award-winning actress of Matilda the Musical], but as soon as they say ‘cut,’ you are no longer with the character. It was interesting to see how other people reacted to it.”
Wolff, on the other hand, said he didn’t incorporate any certain method. He was equally terrified if not fully committed to a scene and the material itself.
 things that I do in this movie, go through the things that I go through, without going home and feeling a little sick to your stomach,” Wolff said. “So I’d say I was seriously affected by everything that was going on. I didn’t feel like when they said ‘cut’ things were over. I felt pretty shaken to the core pretty much the entire way through. But now we’re here, so we made it out.”
Hopefully audiences will make it out, too, because if there’s a film more soaked in insanity than Hereditary, I have yet to see it. It’s going to be one to simultaneously stew on and try to block out of my mind, especially when I go to turn the lights off at night. So sleep tight.",BMI_Doc10_Hereditary,BMI,Horror,Positive,Hereditary
150,PP_Doc1_TheConjuring3,"As we continue to plunder the mixed-up files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the infamous paranormal investigators behind the eventual genre staple The Amityville Horror, it’s clear we’ve now bypassed a state of diminishing returns. The third outing featuring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the sincerely quaint, lavishly vintage Ghostbusters, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, riffs off a documented courtroom drama to explore the alleged demonic possession of a murderer. However, preceding legal proceedings for familiar supernatural antics, the innate strangeness of both the Warrens and this case is lost in a tepid fog of pseudo-religious histrionics.
Director Michael Chaves, who cut his teeth on the familiar (and equally vacuous) The Curse of La Llorona (2019), usurps the reigns from series creator James Wan, the godfather of yet another vibrant franchise (Saw, Insidious) now entering the realm of its death knell. For genre fans appeased by going through the motions, this latest exhumation on the Warrens might superficially appease despite its obvious intentions as another endless franchise cash grab.
In 1981 Brookfield, Massachusetts, a routine exorcism of an 8-year-old child named David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) proved too hot to handle for the representative of the Vatican and his auxiliary supporters Ed and Lorrain Warren (Wilson, Farmiga). With Ed unconscious in the hospital after a heart attack, all parties are distracted by the demon’s whereabouts, leaving the child’s body to inhabit Arne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor), boyfriend of his older sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook). When Arne murders someone, the Warrens convince his lawyer to plead not guilty by demonic possession and thus embark on a case that seems to be much more insidious than their typical issues.
Back in 2013’s initial The Conjuring, the affected performance of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as her unabashedly dowdy cohort seemed fanciful, if not entirely forgivable for their treacly approximations of occultists with a heart of gold. Since then, regular visitations have cast a brighter light upon these increasingly hoary antics (with a bushel of tangential offspring in tows, such as The Nun and the Annabelle series).
Lost in the beautifully irreverent title credit font is the idea of why, in a third installment, we’re rehashing their ‘most alarming discovery.’ Eventually, it’s a film of semantics. Rather than a possession, we’re dealing with a curse, chasing quid pro quo arrangements to find clues that hurtle us haphazardly towards a cornball finale. Penned by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (whose most assured screenplay to date was the shock value fun of 2009’s Orphan, also featuring Farmiga), the Warrens have been cemented into a formidably monotonous routine. Lorraine’s gifts leave her on a dangerous precipice, and the shallow anxiety meant to be generated by Ed’s constant clucking only allows the script to reveal itself as a poorly constructed glob of lip-synching.
The end credits feature actual photos of the Warrens, revealing the weird possibilities of more intriguing casting (someone out there could do something genuinely bizarro with Grace Zabriskie as Lorraine), and an even less assured supporting cast in this third installment negates the possibility of pleasurable side distractions. Early 80s tunes proliferate the soundtrack but can’t conjure (pun intended) the correct period.
If Eddie Money is fun, Presley’s “Suspicious Minds” (recently blaring over home speakers in Army of the Dead) is too on the nose. However, the film’s most persuasively constructed scene, set to Blondie’s Call Me, while not coming so far as to court the iconicity of American Gigolo’s opening credits, channels an eeriness the rest of the film lacks. Character actors John Noble and Eugenie Bondurant (in spinster-ish Geraldine Chaplin attire) have a briefly compelling moment or two. Still, in this go-round, the devil’s doing the same old dance.",PP_Doc1_TheConjuring3,PP,Horror,Negative,The_Conjuring_The_Devil_Made_Me_Do_It
151,PP_Doc2_TheConjuring3,"Based on “the demonic case that shocked America,” The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It centers on the first known court case in U.S. history that sought to prove innocence based upon a claim of demonic possession. Set in 1981, we begin with an extended prologue sequence where Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Farmiga) attend the turbulent exorcism of eight-year-old David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard).
Amid David’s demonic screams and horrifying body contortions, Ed begins to suffer a heart attack and witnesses David’s sister’s boyfriend, Arne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor), selflessly demanding the young boy’s demon possess him instead. As Ed recovers in hospital under heavy sedation, he can’t warn anyone of Arne’s potential possession and the dangers it could bring.
Soon enough, Arne begins to experience terrifying visions and demonic voices, leading to the brutal murder of his oafish landlord Bruno (Ronnie Gene Blevins). Desperate to prove his innocence, Arne turns to the Warrens to help convince a jury that a demonic spirit possessed him. But as the Warrens dig deeper into Arne’s case, they soon uncover signs that point to a satanic curse that could have dire consequences for all involved.
I’d never heard of Johnson’s case or Warren’s attempts to prove demonic possession could be used as the defense of an unconscionable crime. After reading the Wikipedia entry, it’s clear writer David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick has taken significant liberties with the truth of this real-life event. When you see the words “based on a true story” on the film’s poster, take that with a large grain of salt. Just take the whole damn saltshaker.
Unsurprisingly, the Warrens never battled a satanic curse in the aftermath of Johnson’s misdemeanor, nor did the presiding judge even allow any suggestion of demonic possession to be entered as a defense into his courtroom for the jury to hear. But, hey, why let the truth get in the way of a good horror story? What’s instead of telling is how Johnson-McGoldrick’s screenplay fails even to mention the Warrens were already negotiating lectures, a book deal, and a movie based on Johnson’s crime before the case even went to trial, which certainly casts some shadow of a doubt on their involvement.
The film never once stops to ponder if Johnson was guilty of murder or treat Bruno (his real name was Bono) as the actual victim of a senseless and unprovoked crime. There’s no speculation here. In the eyes of this mostly fictitious film, Arne Johnson was possessed by a demonic spirit, which inherently makes him innocent of murder. This may not make audiences squirm as I did, but there’s something that feels wrong about failing even to question the validity of Johnson’s claims in the name of horror cinema. Seek out 2005’s The Exorcism of Emily Rose for a better example of a courtroom drama centered on an apparent possession that offers both sides of the story for the viewer to determine their own opinion.
Despite what the trailers may have you believe, Johnson-McGoldrick and director Michael Chaves don’t focus too heavily on Johnson’s trial or Warren’s attempts at a wild defense never before seen in a U.S. courtroom. Part buddy-cop detective film, part paranormal spookiest, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It deviates from the foundation director James Wan established in the previous two movies and travels down its outlandish path of satanic worship, witches, curses, and zombies (okay, they’ve technically possessed corpses, but close enough).
While Wan remains one of the film’s producers and receives a story credit, his absence in the director’s chair is painfully noticeable. Wan’s two films featured his trademark penchant for patiently building suspense and letting the camera draw an audience into dark spaces that may or may not contain something horrific. Chaves prefers a more bombastic, forceful style drowning in nauseatingly obvious jump scares, grotesque imagery, loud noises, and supernatural silliness that throws any sense of realism out the window.
All the paranormal activity found in the previous two films was still grounded in some semblance of reality. You cannot say the same for the third outing, particularly the chaotic and utterly ridiculous third act where Ed and Lorraine play a dizzying cat-and-mouse game with a menacing witch inside a dark catacomb. At the same time, Arne begins pulling demonic moves that would make Linda Blair blush. However, by this point, we’ve spent so little time with our possessed protagonist that it’s hard to even care about what he’s experiencing.
It’s ultimately left to Wilson and Farmiga to save The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. Thankfully, they’re more than up to the task of rescuing this film from its messy screenplay. Their infectious chemistry remains as strong as ever, especially in scenes where Chaves explores the Warrens’ undying love for each other, including a gorgeous flashback to their first date. Farmiga effortlessly captures Lorraine’s tortured soul with ease. At the same time, Wilson is typically charming as the ultimate wingman to his wife’s dangerous ventures where the duo faces the demons torturing the innocent.
For all its faults, there’s still plenty of atmospheric chills and thrills to be found here. An unsettling sequence involving a waterbed is terrifying (and perhaps a slight nod to A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master), and the film’s opening prologue, which features sly visual references to The Exorcist and The Shining, is genuinely unnerving. If you can overlook the screenplay’s liberties with the truth (it is a movie, after all), this is still a decently enjoyable horror film hiding amongst much silliness.
By deviating far from the evocative style of the first two films, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It attempts something new but doesn’t have the skills to stick the landing. With enough solid horror moments to set your heart racing and a terrific duo leading proceeding, it’s still an engaging and occasionally fun film that rarely lags. However, if this is the final cinematic outing for Ed and Lorraine Warren, they’re going out with a mild whimper than a thunderous roar.

152,PP_Doc3_TheConjuring3,"About 10 minutes into The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, I was conjuring up images that were infinitely more frightening than the ones on the screen. I can’t think of a single scene that worked. The glossy sequel, directed by Michael Chaves, never generates any tension or scares; its mystery is half-assed, its emotions manufactured by an algorithm. The film sits there, a multi-million-dollar waste. Why does it exist? The devil – sorry – Hollywood execs made them do it.
The movie starts with a laughably heightened sequence of the Warrens, Ed (Patrick Wilson), and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), assisting in the exorcism of little, bespectacled David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard). The devil then invades teenager Arne (Ruairi O’Connor), who soon stabs his manager and is promptly arrested. It doesn’t take long for Ed and Lorraine to convince a skeptical lawyer to plead “not guilty because of demonic possession.” “Come over for dinner,” the Warrens cheekily tell her, in the film’s most inspired moment, “we’ll introduce you to Annabelle.”
The Warrens decide to retrace David’s possession to see if they missed anything. That’s when The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It slows way the f**k down, its mystery unfolding with the urgency of a bloated corpse. Our beloved heroes piece together clues, while redundant flashbacks transport us to Ed and Lorraine’s meet-cute. An eccentric local priest spouts nonsense; blood gushes out of the shower, bodies twist and contort at impossible angles, and creatures from he’ll crawl towards the camera. When the convoluted, shrieky finale arrives, it all blends into nothing more than dull background noise. Your investment in the story will be indirectly proportional to its running time.
At one point, a water mattress is introduced. Only the most naïve viewer will be shocked by what happens next. This is the level of predictability we’re working with here. Everything is immersed in either pastel browns, darkness, or heavy fog. Jarring, blaring cuts constitute the only scares. I wish I could say that David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick’s dialogue makes up for those clichés, but nope. “You know, I met Elvis once,” Lorraine states. “Was that before or after he died?” a character asks her. “Before… and after,” she replies. Touché. Ed proclaims: “You promised a demon a soul in another eloquent instance. Well, you can go to hell without one.”
I had trouble believing things like Lorraine’s clairvoyant sequences, wherein it looks like she’s deep into playing an intense VR game, sans the headset. The cutting between two storylines renders both infinitely less effective. Like most other chapters in this series, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It tries too hard by doing too much. True horror doesn’t come from spooky makeup, dream sequences, or “boo” moments. It comes from sympathetic characters, things left unseen, your mind conjuring (sorry) images much more frightening than any filmmaker could muster. The over-reliance on familiar tropes – it hinges overall “Lorraine wandering through the otherworld” scenes – bogs it down further into the pits of cinematic hell.
Farmiga runs around wide-eyed and horrified throughout it all, while Wilson seems as earnest as ever (“earnest” should be his middle name). The duo still manages to add a touch of class, if not depth, to the proceedings. Strip away the impeccable production values and what you get is another bottom-of-the-barrel, cheesy-as-all-hell exorcism film. The fact that it’s based on a real story, the 1981 “Devil made Me Do it” trial, will only make you wish you were watching a doc on the subject instead.
A blatant cash-grab, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, may stumble at the box office due to a specific other (infinitely better) little horror flick dominating it at the moment. Unless I’m way off, that is, and folks are clamoring to exorcise some demons. In any case, a theater showing this title is bound to be a tranquil place.

",PP_Doc3_TheConjuring3,PP,Horror,Negative,The_Conjuring_The_Devil_Made_Me_Do_It
153,PP_Doc4_TheConjuring3,"I remember seeing James Wan’s The Conjuring for the first time in 2017 and being utterly petrified during the entire runtime to the point where I couldn’t sleep at night. The film was so effective at utilizing familiar horror cues, such as jump scares, and reinventing them in a way where it would fit its increasingly eerie atmosphere and become amazingly scary.
Wan is highly literate with classic horror and knows exactly how to subvert tropes to pull the audience in. His two Conjuring films are the only good pictures in this ever-expansive “cinematic universe” filled with pedantic spinoff films such as the Annabelle trilogy (with a somewhat decent middle chapter by David F. Sandberg), the dreadful The Nun , and the generic The Curse of La Llorona.
When it was announced that La Llorona filmmaker Michael Chaves would helm the latest installment in the saga of Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, warning signs were already flashing in the back of my mind. Not only was La Llorona an ordinary horror film filled with the most predictable and unimaginative jump scares you can think of, but it also had a drab digital aesthetic and an incredibly convoluted story. The streak continues for Chaves, as The Devil Made Me Do It manages to turn the most exciting supernatural horror I’ve seen since Richard Donner’s The Omen into a tedious jump scare-filled picture that’s not only uninterested in what it wants to say but is also exceedingly unscary.
However, the film starts promisingly with a cathartic exorcism scene with many cues recalling William Friedkin’s The Exorcist, such as the famous shot of a hat-wearing priest looking out at the house where he’ll perform the exorcism. Unlike Father Merrin, the priest (barely) survives the exorcism and causes Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) to have a heart attack. After the possessed child, David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard), performs gruesome contortions with his body and almost kills Ed, Arne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor) asks the demon to take him instead of David does.
Ed and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) now investigate the demon’s origins that possessed David and Arne, quickly revealed as a curse. This opening scene supposedly sets the stage for what’s to come: effective scares with several “oh my god” moments sprinkled throughout. However, after its traditional text crawl, the movie stops dead in its tracks and starts becoming the most generic horror film I’ve seen since The Curse of La Llorona.
After its opening scene, The Devil Made Me Do It rapidly turns into predictable fluff, with jump scares featuring loud musical cues and fakeouts you see coming a mile away. Here’s the thing: there is nothing more annoying than a predictable jump scare. Jump scares aren’t scary — they’re either obnoxiously loud, formularized or both. The only film that achieved the overuse of jump scares in recent memory was Andy Muschietti’s 2017 remake of It, but only after it established Pennywise as a terrifying creature. The projector scene is a classic example of that—you can see the scare coming a mile away, but you don’t expect to see Pennywise leaping out of the screen and running to attack the children.
The Devil Made Me Do It strictly uses the jump scare with the intent of giving the audience an adrenaline rush and making them think that it’s scary. Still, when you exactly know when it’s going to happen, without any suspension of disbelief, it then becomes tough to impress, even if the film desperately wants to.
The Devil Made Me Do It wants to impress with jump scares because it doesn’t have a compelling story to tell. It has a shell of an exciting tale but never fully fleshes it out and, as a result, becomes confusing. I’ll admit that, during the final act, I had no clue what was going on with Ed and Lorraine. The film is so busy setting up the next jump scare that it completely forgets about crafting a great story to invest the audience in. Heck, before any legitimate scares happened, the first Conjuring film sets up interesting characters and a somewhat decent story before blowing the audience away and traumatizing them in the process.
Of course, the only ones that genuinely seem to care in this installment are Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warrens. Their chemistry is as good as ever, and they’re also the only convincing actors in the entire film. Every other character is thinly developed and performed in a way you’ll immediately forget about after walking out of the theatre. Everyone seems so uninterested in figuring out the film’s non-mystery that it becomes straightforward for us audience members to check out and stop giving a damn.
It is a shame because the previous Conjuring films (not the spinoffs) cared about the story they were telling — always setting up the account before the scares and building it in a way that it became incredibly effective once the pin drops would happen because the audience would be invested in the story. In The Devil Made Me Do It, the scares happen too quickly, too often, without an initial set-up story.
Jump scares aren’t scary, as I’ve previously mentioned, and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It wants you to think they are terrifying. Yet, nothing is terrifying about speakers cranking up to 11, in a Merzbow-like sound design, in which the film’s quieter sequences have barely perceptible dialogues, almost as if the characters are whispering to one another. Still, the so-called “scary scenes” are overbearingly loud. If this film is your return to theatres, be forewarned that it could be the loudest film you’ll see all year.
The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is only loud for the sake of being loud because it’s cooler to experience loud noises on the big screen and have a collective experience of the most formulaic haunted house sounds you could ever imagine. Yes, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are excellent. Still, it’s not enough to save the movie from being something else other than an unimaginative bore, filled with cheap “scares” and an uninteresting story that’s not even being fleshed out for its audience. It’s finally time to retire this franchise once and for all unless Wan miraculously comes back. If not, lock it in the Warrens’ MacGuffin room forever and ever, until someone (unfortunately) opens it again.

",PP_Doc4_TheConjuring3,PP,Horror,Positive,The_Conjuring_The_Devil_Made_Me_Do_It
154,PP_Doc5_TheConjuring3,"In 1981, paranormal investigators/real-life-con-artists-but-nevermind Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) were on the front lines of yet another demonic possession — this time of eight-year-old David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard), who pretzels his body and speaks in tongues while under the influence of a demonic force. However, their exorcism is interrupted by the intervention of Arne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor), boyfriend of David’s sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook), who draws the demon out of young David…and into himself.
It’s not long after that that Arne murders while ostensibly under the influence of the said spirit, which draws the Warrens back on the case. This time, they’re not just looking to oust an evil force but prove in a court of law that Arne’s crimes were the result of demonic possession. And along the way, they might uncover more earthly powers with an agenda to draw these spirits into our world.
Back in the Saddle Again: While the original Conjuring was a chilling horror hit that spawned a significant number of sequels since it first premiered in 2013 — from the uninspiring Annabelle and The Nun to the more-inventive Annabelle sequels, and so on — The Devil Made Me Do It is the first direct sequel we’ve had since 2016’s The Conjuring 2. Derived from another “based on a true story (with heavy asterisks)” case, this third entry drops us into Johnson’s real-life case, the first time demon possession was cited as a legal defense in a murder trial.
As such, director Michael Chaves (who previously directed The Curse of La Llorona) takes a different tack here, curiously leaning less towards outright scares and more towards the atmosphere of a police procedural. Granted, the usual James Wan-inspired tricks are here: the nostalgia-soaked ’70s aesthetic, the breath-catching long takes that lead to jump scares, the deliberate nods to horror films of the past.
This time, though, we’re left with diminishing returns: the jumps are hollow, the twists predictable, and the references above feel eye-rollingly obvious. A priest stands under a streetlamp holding a briefcase, Exorcist-style; a temporarily-possessed Ed stalks Lorraine in a demonic series of tunnels, limping while swinging a sledgehammer like he’s doing Jack Torrance cosplay. Chaves and cinematographer Michael Burgess may feel like they’re winking cleverly at the audience, but it comes across as self-indulgent.
It doesn’t help, of course, that the film’s seemingly deliberate shift from supernatural horror to police thriller puts a significant damper on the genre thrills that we’re supposed to feel with this otherwise strong series. There’s nothing wrong with playing with the genre and trying new things: hell, Annabelle Comes Home essentially serves as The Conjuring 2.5, switching gears into a fun teen-oriented haunted house ride with the Warrens deep in the periphery. But this time, they’ve moved from demonologists to detectives, David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick awkwardly grafting them into an episodic, investigative film that struggles to build up any sense of suspense or momentum.
Compounding the issue is the film’s extended periods spent away from the charismatic Warrens with our new set of less-than-remarkable supporting characters. O’Connor’s Arne is a sweet enough boy, but he spends much of the time behind bars waiting for the Warrens to clear his name spiritually. John Noble shines in a few critical scenes as a lapsed occult investigator, and Eugenie Bondurat’s sinister Occultist provides plenty of chilling stillness (when she finally shows up). But by the time we reach the bifurcated climax, you’ll be left wondering, “Why are these strangers the ones doing the big exorcism at the end while Ed and Lorraine stalk each other in tunnels?”

Love Means Never Having to Say “The Power of Christ Compels You”: Despite its problems, there are still fits and spurts of the third Conjuring that work, mostly when Wilson and Farmiga are on-screen. At this point, we know them as well as any horror protagonist we’ve met this century, and their settled, earnest love for each other is a refreshing change from the horny teens and tormented adults of horror films past. Granted, it’d be folly to project that kind of kindness on the real-life Warrens, but these handsome, well-coiffed versions of the duo serve nicely as idealized fantasy versions of the demon-hunting crusaders.
The Devil Made Me Do It cements the series’ focus on the Warrens as a great love that can survive whatever Satanic influences may stand in their way. It’s these moments that prove strangely comforting even in their darkest periods. Ed’s heart issues — teased throughout the series as a potential cause of his demise, like a coronary Sword of Damocles — are the closest the pair gets to actual danger. Paradoxically, that we like the Warrens so much is a significant hurdle in The Conjuring 3‘s fear factor: They’re just too hot, sound, and in love with each other to get hurt. Plus, there are always more sequels to be made.
The Verdict: Honestly, points go to Chaves and crew for trying something different with The Devil Made Me Do It: perhaps recognizing the formula was getting stale, they decided to try balancing it with some new procedural tricks. But all it ends up doing is scattering the film’s sense of identity even further; we still get the scares, but they don’t work as well, mainly because they deal with people we don’t care about. The Warrens have too much plot armor to make them feel genuinely in peril, and it’s that unstoppability that makes the film lose more than a little bit of focus.
",PP_Doc5_TheConjuring3,PP,Horror,Negative,The_Conjuring_The_Devil_Made_Me_Do_It
155,PP_Doc6_TheConjuring3,"All hell breaks loose early and often in “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It.” A creepy old Connecticut house shudders in the grip of demonic forces that shred the wallpaper (an improvement, honestly) and tear at the body and soul of an 11-year-old boy, triggering acrobatic contortions so violent they make Linda Blair’s head spins look like hot yoga. If “The Exorcist” seems by now too obvious a point of reference, it’s one this movie nonetheless invokes, first when an old priest arrives on this misty night and later when a heroic young man dares the devil to abandon the poor boy and take him instead.
The devil gladly complies, vacating the body of young David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) and seizing hold of his older sister’s boyfriend, Arne Cheyenne Johnson (Ruairi O’Connor). But Arne, rather than hurling himself to death, lives on, now hosting a demonic parasite that takes its not-so-sweet time to make itself known. Jump scares galore ensue, blowing your eardrums and filling the screen with jack-in-the-box apparitions and hallucinatory washes of red. By the time Arne is arrested for the brutal murder of his landlord (Ronnie Gene Blevins), the movie has already laid out its case, aptly summed up by the title.
Proving it in a court of law will be a trickier matter, one that naturally falls to Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), that God-fearing, the ghost-busting duo who have given these movies their romantic pulse and spiritual oomph. In this latest movie, directed by Michael Chaves from a script by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, they set out to prove that Arne is not guilty because of demonic possession. This tricky task will bring them into contact with all manner of fellow true believers and professional skeptics. (The fine ensemble cast includes Keith Arthur Bolden, Ashley LeConte Campbell, Eugenie Bondurant, and especially John Noble as a delectably strange priest turned paranormal expert.)
Like its superior predecessors, “The Conjuring” (2013) and “The Conjuring 2” (2016), “The Devil Made Me Do It” was ripped from one of the Warrens’ real-life case files, this one centered on a 1981 murder trial that they successfully — and none too scrupulously — turned into a cause célèbre. Whether you regard the Warrens as righteous spiritual warriors, wily hucksters, or both, their self-promotional acumen has never been in doubt, as the mere existence of these movies amply demonstrates. (Ed Warren died in 2006; Lorraine Warren, a consultant on the series, died in 2019.)
As a rule, the words “based on a true story” should trigger any viewer’s skepticism; that’s even more, the case when a movie is as straight-faced in its presentation of supernatural events as these are. Not that you had to believe a second of the first two “Conjuring” movies — both directed with pulse-quickening intensity by James Wan (who’s credited as a producer here) — to find them wildly entertaining, mainly since stories about possessions and hauntings are predicated on a shivery suspension of disbelief, to begin with. If the illusion is slower to take hold in “The Devil Made Me Do It,” it’s because of the heightened moral stakes — the question of a man’s guilt or innocence in the matter of a monstrous crime — as well as the movie, ’s a more skillful approach to shocks and scares.
Chaves made his feature debut with “The Curse of La Llorona” (2019), one of several feature-length offshoots, like “The Nun” and the “Annabelle” movies, in the increasingly tangled “Conjuring” franchise. (I think we’re supposed to call it a universe, but some directives, like the devil himself, should be resisted.) Chaves is a solid craftsman with a weakness for easy jolts, but also a gift for filling the frame with strategically unnerving pools of light and shadow; he can turn even a daylit room into something ominous and suggestive. He also orchestrates a memorable flashback to young David’s first encounter with evil, a scene that will make you grateful that waterbeds went the way of the dodo.
What Chaves doesn’t demonstrate so far is anything approaching the kinetic virtuosity of Wan’s filmmaking, his ability to send the camera skittering up and down hallways and stranding us alongside the characters in a twisted funhouse of horrors. To some degree, that’s the right approach for this particular story, where the real antagonist isn’t a haunted house but rather a curse of mysterious and exceedingly malicious provenance. Ed and Lorraine have admittedly broken many curses over the years, amassing a storehouse of creepy dolls and tchotchkes in the process (as referenced in one of the movie’s slyer punchlines). But nothing they’ve done has entirely prepared them for this case’s swerve into satanic cult worship, blood sacrifice, and other forms of occult deviance, all of which operate by their own outlandishly sinister rules.
It’s in the parsing of those rules that “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” hits the occasional sweet spot, if less consistently or surprisingly, than its predecessors did. Narratively speaking, the most enjoyable aspect of these films is the way they function as paranormal detective stories, knottily intricate puzzles in which the battle for the human soul also becomes a battle of wits. That’s another reason why the Warrens — at least as played by Farmiga and Wilson, making the most as always of their retro-nerdy-sexy chemistry — are such an endearing detective duo: They’re Nick and Nora with less banter and more holy water.
It helps, of course, that the Warrens come off as committed (some might say committable) do-gooders and that you never catch them, say, eagerly negotiating book and movie deals mid-trial, as their real-life counterparts are said to have done. That’s not the only time “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do it” stacks your sympathies in favor of Ed and Lorraine, never more risibly than with sepia-toned flashbacks to their original meet-cute — the beginnings of a love story to make audiences swoon and demons shudder. Here, and not for the first or last time, the power of kitsch compels you.

156,PP_Doc7_TheConjuring3,"“The court accepts the existence of God every time a witness swears to tell the truth,” Patrick Wilson’s Ed Warren says at one point in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, a line featured in many of the film’s marketing materials. He continues, “I think it’s about time they accept the existence of the devil.” It’s a strong marketing hook for the significant screen return of the endlessly endearing paranormal superheroes, with the general premise for the third mainline Conjuring film — the eighth overall in the expanded Conjuring Universe, however — allowing Ed and Lorraine Warren to do something a little bit different this time around. Rather than banishing spooky spirits inside a creepy house, Ed and Lorraine hit the road, setting out to prove that a recent murder was the result of demonic possession.
Set in 1981, a new setting for a franchise that has previously only played around in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It begins where most possession-based horror movies would end: with a wild exorcism. At the exorcism of a young boy named David Glatzel, Ed and Lorraine Warren witness the demonic spirit jump into the body of Arne Johnson, whose real-life story the movie is based on. Johnson subsequently killed a man and became the first person in America to claim demonic possession to defend murder. The film centers on Ed and Lorraine’s quest to track down the demon responsible.
Not all Conjuring movies are created equal, and two main things have separated the mainline film from the various spinoffs over the years. For starters, The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 were directed by franchise architect James Wan, and both movies centered on Patrick Wilson’s Ed Warren and Vera Farmiga’s Lorraine Warren. These two factors have lent a “prestige” quality to the core movies in the franchise, and the good news here is that Wilson and Farmiga are very much back and as charming as ever in The Devil Made Me Do It. On the flip side, however, this is the first non-spinoff Conjuring movie that wasn’t directed by James Wan himself, with Michael Chaves (The Curse of La Llorona) taking over the reins.
With this one, we have to take the good with the not-so-good.
You’d be hard-pressed to find two more likable horror heroes than Wilson and Farmiga, whose loving relationship continues to be the very heart and soul of the Conjuring franchise. The individual charms they exude and palpable chemistry they share makes for an endless well that these movies can continuously tap into, and The Devil Made Me Do It isn’t afraid to tap that well for all it’s worth. The romance between Ed and Lorraine is front and center in The Conjuring 3, complete with flashbacks this time around that help to build out the history of their relationship. Sure, we’ve mostly seen all the lovey-dovey stuff before. Still, Wilson and Farmiga are so good together that those moments continue to provoke an emotional response that ensures these movies aren’t just horror stories but love stories as well. And with Ed not exactly 100% for much of this one, Farmiga gets a nice solo spotlight here, carrying the investigation on her back and showing off her abilities in fun new ways.
While The Devil Made Me Do It unquestionably shines when it’s focused on being a love story between two of the best characters Hollywood horror has given us in recent years, the film, unfortunately, stumbles when it comes time to deliver the mess that James Wan has become so adept at bringing to the table. The elegant, well-crafted sequences of terror that Wan masterfully peppered into The Conjuring and The Conjuring 2 are mainly absent from the series’s third installment, replaced with far more generic horror movie scares that quite honestly don’t ever feel like they’re doing much justice to the Conjuring brand. Particularly in that scare-crafting department, Wan’s absence is very much felt here, with various set-pieces being so underutilized that they fail to bring the fear or make any lasting impression.
And it’s not just the scares that are underwhelming, but the storytelling as well. While The Devil Made Me Do It seems primed and ready to deliver a whole new kind of Conjuring movie, it’s primarily comfortable going through the same motions we’ve already seen before. True, we’re dealing with a man on trial for demonically-possessed murder this time around, but there’s no actual trial to speak of here and no mystery behind the whole thing either. We already know what’s right out of the gate, and the only question that’s left to be answered is in regards to the demon responsible for what’s going on. While James Wan effortlessly created new horror icons in the previous films, the villain in The Devil Made Me Do It is both uninteresting and underdeveloped, easily the series’s dullest adversary to date. And while it’s positioned as the most sinister opponent, the Warrens have ever faced, that’s never actually felt beyond some violent bits that do admittedly go harder than expected.
All around, the script for The Devil Made Me Do It fails to connect the dots necessary to bring any real depth or resonance to the various storylines, with Arne Johnson’s story sidelined in much the same way the main villains is. And it’s a bummer because there are clear parallels between all of the major players that the movie doesn’t ever seem to have much interest in exploring. Arne Johnson and his girlfriend feel like young versions of Ed and Lorraine, while even the villain’s backstory interestingly links to the Warrens. But the movie seems to constantly be missing those connections, resulting in a flat story that ultimately leaves you feeling like there’s not much gas left in this franchise’s tank. By the time yet another object is added to the Warrens’ artifact room at the end of the movie, it’s hard not to feel like the entire thing was as perfunctory as the lesser spinoffs have been.
Even the 1980s setting in The Devil Made Me Do It barely registers as anything fresh or new, with one early integral scene putting a classic 80s tune to good use. Still, the film otherwise ignores the decade altogether. For the most part, it feels like this third installment is still set in either the 60s or 70s, which is a minor gripe. Still, it would’ve been fun to see Chaves and the team play just a little more with the franchise’s first foray into an iconic decade with such a well-defined aesthetic attached to it. Mind you, 80s nostalgia is overplayed at this point, but a touch of it would’ve been welcome here.
For the most part, all the ground that’s covered in The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It was already covered more effectively in the previous two movies, begging the question of how much more can be milked from the Warrens’ extensive case files. The little bits of flashback footage here suggest that the more exciting approach is perhaps an Ed and Lorraine prequel story down the road. However, it’s hard to imagine the characters being played by anyone other than Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. They continue to be as winning as ever in their fourth major appearance in the extended Conjuring Universe. Still, they can only do so much heavy lifting when everything surrounding them isn’t up to snuff. For the first time, the magic they bring to the table feels like it deserves a better movie.
And this one made me miss being in the palm of James Wan’s hand.

157,PP_Doc8_TheConjuring3,"The “Conjuring” series has taken horror out of the secular universe — where it has been mired for the last two generations — and has returned it to a world of metaphysical good and evil. In doing so, it has given horror back its power.
This isn’t to say that all the “Conjuring” movies have been good. But the general direction of the series is sound, and “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” is one of the better ones.
There is nothing scarier than something unseen and powerful working to destroy you. When the unseen force is invisible, and when the powerful force is all-powerful — that’s practically the definition of scary. For many years, slashers were synonymous with horror. But those movies try to disturb us most cheaply by threatening to show something disgusting, or unexpected, or unexpectedly awful. We jump, laugh, and watch from a distance because the characters’ problems aren’t ours. But the best horror — like “Frankenstein,” “Dracula,” “Carnival of Souls,” “The Exorcist,” “The Omen,” and “The Shining” — get under our skin by challenging our comforting assumptions about reality. They suggest a universe that might be actively malevolent.
Based on a true story, “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” brings back the demonologist team of Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), who is once again doing their best to cast out Satan. A little boy is possessed, and the Warrens are present, along with the family and the obligatory useless priest, standing there with the rosary shaking in his hand.
“The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” throws us into action almost immediately. The house vibrates, ill winds blow through it, and the little boy’s body distorts into hideous contortions. It is genuinely disturbing and clearly out of control until a young family friend, Arne (Ruairi O’Connor), looks into the boy’s eyes and addresses the demon. He gets the devil to leave the boy by inviting it into himself.
Like most things that happen in the first five minutes of a movie, this is not a good idea. We wait to see exactly how bad an idea is, and we’re not disappointed. Soon the Warrens are working as defense investigators in a murder trial. They’re trying to prove that young Arne, who winds up stabbing someone 21 times, was not responsible for the murder; the devil made him do it.
In this new “Conjuring,” every scene of demonic possession, every demonic hallucination, and every underworld visit and visitation land with unsettling impact. These are, in a sense, action scenes, and they’re creepy, chilling, and very well done. Their effectiveness is aided by knowing that the movie tells a true story or at least a supposedly true story.
But we should expect all this from a decent genre picture. What puts the movie a notch above that is the performance of Farmiga as Lorraine Warren. Farmiga plays the role as if she is living, at all times, in two worlds simultaneously. She’s here, but she’s also there, seeing visions of past crimes and communing with the spirits of the dead. The lovely actor’s choice Farmiga makes is that Lorraine is so familiar with the other side that she’s offhand about these things. She says things blandly that we might say screaming.
What better way to show us that the spirit world is as evident and present to her as the tangible world? By acting like it, Farmiga makes us believe it’s real.

158,PP_Doc9_TheConjuring3,"Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are as thrilling and chilling as ever, but the latest film in the possession franchise is messy, stilted, and just not scary.
“The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” starts strong, kicking off with the sort of haunted-house possession story that made both “The Conjuring” and “The Conjuring 2” so nerve-shredding. It’s the summer of 1981, and the Glatzel family is weeks into a horror that only paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) can address. Mop-topped David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) has been possessed by something. This evil entity delights in torturing the sweet kiddo and tearing apart the Glatzels’ new Connecticut home in equal measure.
Like its predecessors, “The Devil Made Me Do It” approaches demonic possession as, if not irrefutably “real,” at least something the Warrens believe in wholeheartedly, and thus something they can battle back through their years of hard-won experience and education. Something horrible is happening to David. As director Michael Chaves — taking over from original series director James Wan after making his debut with maligned spin-off “The Curse of La Llorona” — plunges the audience, the Warrens, and the Glatzels into the terror. There’s no time to worry about the facts: David contorts, David twists, David screams out in horror, all as his family and the Warrens do their literal damnedest to free him.
The first two “Conjuring” films tread similar ground: intimate, boxed-in haunted house stories about families driven to madness, and that “The Devil Made Me Do It” opens to indicate that more of the same is on the way. Unfortunately, this entry has far more on its mind, and screenwriter David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (“The Conjuring 2,” “Orphan”) soon turns to the real story at the film’s heart: the horrible stuff that happened after David’s possession.
As with the previous two features, “The Devil Made Me Do It” is based on a true story that entangled the real-life Warrens: This one was the horrific murder of Alan Bono some months after David was presumably freed from his demonic captor. Amid the film’s opening sequence, Chaves and Johnson-McGoldrick indicate that this particular possession is one of the worst the Warrens have ever seen. The impact on the duo is profound, as Ed suffers physically and terrible visions suddenly strike medium, Lorraine. Eventually, it seems, they do free David, but only after Arne (Ruairi O’Connor), the boyfriend of his older sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook), all but begs the entity to leave the kid and take him instead.
Be careful what you wish for. Just as the Glatzels begin piecing their lives back together (and an ill Ed gets, literally, back on his feet), Arne starts suffering from his visions, turning sallow and sweaty, unable to keep his desires (or the entity’s desires?) at bay for too long. Soon enough, he’s offed Debbie’s demented boss, and the Warrens must return to help argue his case on the basis that he was possessed when the murder was committed. If this sounds complicated, it is, making for a messy and stilted first act that switches between time, place, and perspective with little finesse, muddling story, and burying great scares along the way.
Farmiga and Wilson, who add incredible human emotion and dimension to their roles, are as good as ever, nearly making up for the lack of human drama elsewhere. The Warrens must do the emotional heavy lifting without another family to pin the chills and thrills on — like the Perrons in the first film or the Hodgsons in the second. That’s fine: Ed and Lorraine are enthralling characters, and if “The Devil Made Me Do It” threatens to orient itself around their love story first and an awkwardly crafted villain second, there are worse choices to be made. Unfortunately, “The Devil Made Me Do It” starts making those choices, too.
Without the ballast of a central location and a single source of evil, Ed and Lorraine are forced on the road to pursue all manner of red herrings, obvious baddies, and at least one twisted subplot that doesn’t attempt to be rooted in anything remotely realistic. The journey takes the duo, plus an ailing Arne, through creepy locales, ranging from a dimly lit prison infirmary to the grimmest funeral home in America. It’s all so scary that it renders them dull.
A handful of intelligent scares pop up, including a flashback involving little David and a very, very evil waterbed, as well as a final act freakout that sees Farmiga play against herself. However, the spine-tingling slow burn sequences that made the first two films so scary are gone, replaced by procedure and garbled mythology. Bring back the creepy doll; at least she’s got clear-cut motivation! (She’s fine, she’s got her franchise anyway.)
Three films into this series (and eight into the overall “Conjuring” franchise), it’s not shocking those creative wells are starting to run a little dry, though that doesn’t lessen the sting of this particular disappointment. The “Conjuring” franchise began with well-tread stories — hell, the Warrens’ cases have inspired scads of other films and series — told with enough craft and cared to make them critical and commercial darlings. The scariest thing about “The Devil Made Me Do It” is the possibility that it will set the stage for more of this and less of what made the franchise so compelling in the first place.

159,PP_Doc10_TheConjuring3,"James Wan was really onto something when he got the Warrens to the big screen with The Conjuring. Wan may not have known it at the time. Still, he was launching one of the most successful horror franchises ever. The secret to the series success remains the ghost-hunting couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. The Warrens were real people who claimed to be genuine paranormal investigators, but there's much evidence to suggest they were delusional at best or downright frauds at worst. No matter. We're not dealing with the honest Ed and Lorraine in these movies. We're dealing with something better. And it's Wilson and Farmiga's performances that truly seal the deal.
Mining an actual murder for Conjuring material is a somewhat questionable idea. Still, The Devil Made Me Do It skirts around this by going so far into the territory of the implausible that any resemblance to actual events goes out the window. ""Yes, this is a little tasteless,"" the movie seems to be saying. ""But there's no way anyone can take this seriously."" None of this is a knock against the film, mind you. The outlandishness is part of the fun.
While the demonic murder defense starts The Devil Made Me Do It, the film does not turn into a horror movie courtroom drama, a la The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Instead, the murder serves as an excuse to send Ed and Lorraine Warren on the road to get to the bottom of this spooky mystery, Scooby-Doo style. It's a change of pace for the series, and thankfully, it (primarily) works.
As The Devil Made Me Do It begins, the Warrens are doing what they do best: helping out a family besieged by the supernatural. The poor Glatzel family is going through some things as young David Glatzel (Julian Hilliard) has been possessed by demonic forces. The Warrens are on hand to help out with an exorcism, but things go south quickly. Also present at the exorcism is Arne Johnson (Ruairi O'Connor), dating David's older sister Debbie (Sarah Catherine Hook). When the Warrens fail to get the situation under control, Arne takes matters into his own hands and demands the demon possessing David to leave the boy and climb into him instead. The devil obliges, and not long after, the possessed Arne stabs his drunken landlord Bruno (Ronnie Gene Blevins) to death.
Director Michael Chaves, stepping in for Wan (who helped come up with the film's story), stages the murder scene entirely from Arne's warped perspective, and we watch as the young man is confused and terrified as the evil forces inside him twist his perception and torment him into committing the terrible deed. It's practical, disturbing stuff, but you also can't help but watch it and remember that an actual murder happened here (David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's script changes the murder victim's name, presumably to avoid offending anyone). The murder is one of several creepy set pieces that Chaves handles healthy here. The most memorable involves the Warrens on an after-hours trip to the morgue where the corpses are restless, and the lights have a terrible habit of turning off just when the Warrens need them – it's a delightfully spooky scene that will make you squirm.
Locked up and awaiting his trial, Arne is still tormented by demonic visions, and the Warrens are called in to help figure out what's going on here. After snooping around the Glatzel home, the Warrens quickly determine that David and Arne's possessions were not random occurrences. Instead, the Glatzels, and now Arne, are being targeted by someone skilled in the art of black magic. It's up to the Warrens to find out who – and stop them.
After this solid set-up, The Devil Made Me Do It occasionally grows a bit murky. While the Arne Johnson story is the catalyst here, Arne himself feels almost forgotten as the film proceeds. Sure, there are occasional scenes where we see Arne tormented in prison, but he feels entirely secondary, almost as if he's in a different movie. And not a very compelling one, either. It's much more interesting to spend time with the Warrens, especially when they encounter the film's villain. Rather than a demon nun or a ghostly witch, the enemy in The Devil Made Me Do It is a living person. She's a mysterious figure known as The Occultist. While having the Warrens go up against a natural person as an adversary feels slightly strange, it ultimately works thanks to the performance of Eugenie Bondurant. Bondurant strikes a mysterious figure with a scowling face and a gaunt figure. While the character's motivations never really make sense, Bondurant manages to make her a genuinely creepy presence.
Having the Warrens snooping around like Mulder and Scully and pitting them against a human villain turns The Devil Made Me Do It into a kind of mystery movie, a paranormal detective story, even. This could've gotten real silly real fast, but by now, you're either on board with the Warrens, or you're not. It's easy to buy into the paranormal investigators turning into amateur detectives because Wilson and Farmiga are so damn good at playing these roles. They feed off each other's chemistry, and it's a treat to watch them work. Farmiga, in particular, continues to shine here, managing to sell corny lines with gusto. And the ongoing love story between the two characters remains the glue holding all of this together. The Warrens love each other unconditionally, and there's something sweet and wholesome about these two good people who still have the hots for each other even after all these years of chasing ghosts and ghouls.

160,AP_Doc1_Us,"Writer-director Jordan Peele’s 2017 Get Out was a brash and intriguing debut, a picture that wrestled with the notion of whether or not America can ever be a post-racial society: Vital and spooky, it refused to hand over easy answers. With the ambitious home-invasion horror chiller Us, Peele goes even deeper into the conflicted territory of class and race and privilege; he also ponders the traits that make us most human. But this time, he’s got so many ideas he can barely corral them, let alone connect them. He overthinks himself into a corner, and we’re stuck there with him.

Lupita Nyong’o stars as Adelaide, who has overcome a traumatic childhood experience and now has a family of her own, including husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and two kids: graceful, well-adjusted Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and the slightly more awkward Jason (Evan Alex), who wears a wolfman mask pushed up on his head as a kind of security blanket. We meet the comfortably middle-class Wilson family as they’re heading off on vacation to Santa Cruz, the site of Adelaide’s childhood ordeal. On their first night away, they look out and see a family of four, mute and stony echoes of themselves, standing in the driveway. From there, Peele unspools a story of “shadow” people, long forced to live underground but now streaming to the Earth’s surface to claim, violently, what they feel is rightfully theirs.

The effectiveness of Us may depend on how little you know about it going in, so the spoiler-averse may wish to stop reading here. But it’s impossible to address any of the movie’s larger ideas without giving away key plot points: Before long, that shadow family has infiltrated the house, and now that we can get a good look, we see that each of them is a not-quite-right replica of a Wilson, dressed in a red jumpsuit and wielding a pair of menacing-looking shears. At one point a terrified Adelaide asks the other mother, a twin of herself but with vacant, crazy eyes and a demented smile, “What are you people?” “We are Americans,” the lookalike responds, in a whispery growl.

That’s a bright, neon-lit Author’s Message if ever there was one, though the idea of using a group of sunlight-deprived semi-zombies as a metaphorical element in a parable about class complacency isn’t necessarily a bad one. Are you and your family doing great? Do you live in a nice place, drive an expensive car, and have plenty of food for everyone to eat? Be grateful for it. But be aware that there are others who, through no fault of their own, don’t live at the same comfort level—or are, in fact, barely surviving. (The Wilsons also have close friends, Josh and Kitty, played by Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss, who have more money and nicer stuff than they do, a source of irritation for Gabe in particular, and another of the movie’s threads about class consciousness in America.) But Peele doesn’t always lay out his ideas clearly. Us isn’t always fun to watch; there are stretches where it’s plodding and dour. He’s overly fond of heavy-duty references, including Biblical ones: A creepy dude holds a sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11. (If you don’t know it outright, it’s the one that goes, “Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.”) The mood of Us is sometimes chilling, but even then, you’re not always sure what, exactly, is chilling you. Maybe it’s just the feeling of being trapped in an over-air-conditioned lecture hall, because there’s a strain of preachiness running through the whole thing.

One thing that’s unquestionable: Peele is a dazzling visual stylist. (Peele’s cinematographer is Mike Gioulakis, who also shot David Robert Mitchell’s It Follows, as well as M. Night Shyamalan’s Split and Glass.) The movie’s opening, which details young Adelaide’s nightmare—it takes place in a ghoulish hall of mirrors on the Santa Cruz boardwalk—is a mini-horror masterpiece by itself, an evocation of the outright weirdness of childhood rather than its wonder: As the girl wanders away from her parents, in an almost trancelike state, she clutches a candied apple so shiny it’s like blood-red crystal ball—and puts us in a trance, too.

Yet the rest of Us is laden with metaphors, and they pile up so quickly that not even Peele can keep up with them. The movie repeatedly references Hands Across America, a 1986 benefit event in which some 6.5 million people joined hands along a route mapped out across the contiguous United States. (Many participants had donated $10 to reserve a space in the chain; the money was donated to local charities dedicated to fighting hunger and ending poverty.) In Us, the shadow people form a similar chain. But it’s hard to know what Peele is trying to say with that image. Are the semi-zombies of Us just less fortunate versions of us? Are they actually us and we don’t know it? Is their clumsy anger somehow superior to thought and reason? After all, it has unified them, while we aboveground humans are more divided than ever.

How, in the end, are we supposed to feel about these shadow people, for so long deprived of basic human rights—including daylight—that they have become murderous clones? Sometimes great movies are ambiguous, but ambiguity resulting from unclear thinking makes nothing great. It’s one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it’s another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say.",AP_Doc1_Us,AP,Horror,Negative,Us_2019
161,AP_Doc2_Us,"In his 1983 stand-up comedy special Delirious, Eddie Murphy struts the stage in Thriller-era red leathers and ponders why, precisely, white families in horror movies bother lingering in haunted houses. Black people, in Murphy’s estimation, would immediately beat a hasty retreat at the slightest inkling of a forbidding presence. The story goes that Murphy’s joke – and in particular his imagined ghost’s warning to “get out”– planted a seed in the fertile mind of comedian-turned-master-of-horror Jordan Peele.

Peele’s remarkable 2017 feature film debut offered a sophisticated response to Murphy’s challenge. Black people, Get Out argued, can’t simply vacate the proverbial premises because the conditions of their entrapment are present even in the sunny-seeming setting of a superficially welcoming, allegedly “postracial” America. Conceived during the Obama administration but premiering days after the Trump inauguration, Get Out’s premise, and its ability to deliver on it with finely calibrated scares, haunting imagery, and canny satire, hammered a chord. The film minted a fortune, earned accolades (including a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Peele), and instantly enmeshed itself in the contemporary cultural vocabulary. For as long as there are people writing about horror, and satire, and race in America, there will be people writing about Get Out. Expectations for Peele’s follow-up were skewed accordingly. Yet any rumours that his sophomore outing, Us, is “just” a straight-ahead scare-fest seem exaggerated. Although it is foremost a highly entertaining and well-executed horror movie, Us is shot through with its own strain of social criticism. Here the subject is not race, but class, with the film introducing an underworld of voiceless doppelgangers armed with lethal scissors and clad in blood-red onesies that recall, all at once, prison uniforms, working class coveralls and, yes, Delirious-era Murphy.

The film opens on the Santa Cruz boardwalk circa 1986, where a father wins a prize (a baggy Thriller T-shirt, no less – here Peele lucks into his zeitgeistiness) for his young daughter. Ignored by her quarrelling parents, the child ambles into a hall of mirrors, where she meets another a girl, who appears to be her exact double. Cut to 30 years later, and the girl is now a married mother of two played by Lupita Nyong’o, back in sunny Santa Cruz for a beach holiday with her own family. In a film abounding with imagery of doubles, mirrors, rhymes and reflections, it should be no surprise that history repeats itself, with Nyong’o’s young son wandering near the same carnival attraction, and baiting a clan of (almost) exact doubles of his entire family back to their beach house.

From here, Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture. The archly creepy doubles – called “the Tethered,” after the manner in which they are existentially bound to their above-ground versions, like shadows – are a monster worthy of the Universal logo that precedes the film’s opening titles. Peele exhibits a mastery of his camera, of managing suspense, and of teasing (and rewarding) the intimation of violence. He’s also an exceptionally talented director of actors. Nyong’o’s physicality in her dual role as both herself and her Tether is revelatory. (Also excellent: Winston Duke as her husband, whose manner suggests a burlier on-screen surrogate for Peele himself; and Tim Heidecker and Elisabeth Moss as their gaucher, more garishly wealthy friends.) Peele possesses a distinct talent for handling horror and comedy simultaneously, such that jokes landing in the midst of sustained suspense and wanton violence feel both natural and cathartic. There are multiple scenes in which pitched screams descend into fits of laughter, which feels like as fine a trademark for writer/director/producer Peele as his recurring image of a single tear dripping down a face seized by abject terror.

Strangely, this sophomore effort feels like more of a proverbial “calling card picture” than Get Out. It’s as if Peele, rattled by his own hype, is straining to show what he can do as a straight-ahead craftsman, absent all the talk of him being a generational talent with a gift for articulating the issues vexing America. The film’s critique of classism – present not only in the central family’s war against the Tethered, but their hostility toward Heidecker and Moss’s family, with their Botox and smart-home and more souped-up holiday boat rental – is undercooked. In Get Out, the terror, the comedy, and the commentary all felt as if they were producing one another. With Us, it’s as if Peele is struggling to find a contemporary issue onto which he can overlay his horror movie. (You can’t spell “Us” without “U.S.,” and so on.)

Add to this the film’s belaboured mise-en-scène, which telescopes its themes without anything in the way of subtlety. An opening sequence depicting an 80s-vintage home entertainment console adorned with VHS tapes of C.H.U.D., The Goonies, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Man With Two Brains (in which Steve Martin is telepathically linked with a separate brain), serve to twitchily wink at the film’s notion of a bifurcated underworld/overworld structure. Such touches might dazzle in their initial density and deliberateness, but they’re unlikely to generate much in the way of analysis outside of dopey “20 Things You Might Have Missed In Us” YouTube videos.

These are not the markers of a bad film – or a bad filmmaker – by any stretch. But where Get Out felt urgent and preternaturally confident, Us is the work of a gifted director who seems to be compensating for having less to say by overstating how he says it. Peele knows his horror movie canon well enough to realize that the best cheapo fright flicks are not only scary and fun, but shaggy enough to invite interpretation, instead of issuing preachy messaging about The State Of The World Today.

In place of the hushed voices of his debut (or of Murphy’s inciting Delirious joke), you can almost hear Peele goading his audience with Us. It’s less “get out” and more “get it?”",AP_Doc2_Us,AP,Horror,Positive,Us_2019
162,AP_Doc3_Us,"If, for whatever reason, you were still having doubts that Jordan Peele, half the mind behind Key and Peele, which filled the void left from Chappelle’s Show, and the entire mind behind 2017’s monster hit Get Out, as well as the upcoming Twilight Zone reboot, consider them extinguished with the release of Us. Peele has solidified himself as one of the most important and pensive artists of the current generation and beyond, and he’s firing on all cylinders with his sophomore film. The themes and ideas put forth are grander and more all-encompassing than Get Out – this winds up being both good and bad, but the sheer ambition and genius behind it all continues to be mightily impressive. In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide (Madison Curry) is on vacation at the Santa Cruz boardwalk with her parents. Adelaide wanders off while the adults are distracted, as children are prone to do, and winds up exploring a house of mirrors on the beach. What she encounters in there is enough to scar her for life, so much to the point that she’s unable to speak for a considerable amount of time afterwards. Jump to the present day, and a fully grown Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o) is returning to Santa Cruz and facing her fears, along with her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and their two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). What starts off as a fun and refreshing vacation immediately turns into a violent and terrifying nightmare. Four strangers, clad in matching red jumpsuits and each wielding large scissors, show up at the family’s summer home, and they have a thirst for blood. The scariest part? They look exactly like them. Peele is paying homage to the classic horror flicks of the 80s here, and he proudly scatters references and stages scenes inspired by them throughout his film. A young Adelaide wanders the dark beach in an oversized Michael Jackson’s Thriller tee, Jason rocks a Jaws shirt for most of the movie, and a news report echoes the feelings of Night of the Living Dead. There’s no shortage of scares to experience in Us, the most notable being the home invasion sequence that’s dominated most of the marketing. The use of darkness, tight spaces, and angles drive home the fact that the Wilsons are trapped and the walls are both literally and figuratively closing in. Us is far more creepy and unsettling than Get Out was, due in large part to phenomenal performances from the cast pulling double duty, and the violence is on par with the best slasher films. Nyong’o dominates the screen as both Adelaide and her sinister counterpart, playing each role so drastically differently and relying not solely on a change of voice but a change of physicality, that you’d swear they were inhabited by different actors. Adelaide is a former ballerina, and thus moves with speed, grace, and lightness, but her shadow moves in very staticky and jerky movements, more like a machine or a puppet than a normal human being. The doppelgangers, who call themselves The Tethered, are a bold statement in concept alone. Literally living underground, their lives are filled with nothing but pain and misery while their other halves get to enjoy the sunlight and all the glorious things the world has to offer.

It’s here that Peele unleashes his true ideas with Us – it’s a funhouse mirror reflection back at the audience, at all of us, that forces us to look at the cost of our lives and the way we live them. It’s no accident that the Wilsons are shown to be an upper class family (not filthy rich but certainly not struggling, they have a summer house for god’s sake), with a dynamic that mimics the standard American image: The no-nonsense mother, the goofy father, the standoffish daughter, and the troublemaker son. We often forget, or rather, continuously choose to ignore, the price of that kind of lifestyle. How many people around the world suffer not just while we flourish, but suffer in order for us to flourish? The Tethered are the ultimate symbol for the forgotten people that excessive living steps on and abuses in order to maintain itself – they’re a stinging and uncomfortable look at the lives we destroy and put out of our minds so that we can enjoy that summer home, that new car, that iPhone, those new clothes. And of course they look like us, not just to remind us that these are people and not monsters, but to show that the true horror, the true murderers, the true enemies, are us. It’s a brilliant metaphor, and Peele mostly succeeds at the numerous themes and concepts he stuffs into the nearly two hour film. But they are numerous, and as the film goes on it can begin to feel a bit overly ambitious, and the lack of focus and precision bleeds through, especially when you compare it to the very streamlined Get Out.

There’s so much to unpack with Us that it feels impossible to wrap your mind around all that it has to offer with just one watch. Similar to his first film, Peele practically demands multiple viewings, and it’s certain to spawn even more videos and essays breaking it all down and explaining the various references, Easter eggs, and themes. The movie feels like it could’ve benefited from either being split into two parts or finding a single idea to focus a bit more on instead of throwing all of them together at once. Still, Us is a hell of a ride that’s bursting with Peele’s now signature style and humor. The final confrontation is one of my favorite movie moments of the year, and its ending lands on a truly unsettling gut punch. Don’t sleep on this one.

163,AP_Doc4_Us,"We can probably all agree that looking at your phone or talking during a movie is rude. But something we don’t really think about and ought to recognize is that these are anxiety-reducing activities. That’s not an excuse, you still shouldn’t do it, but knowing this kept me from being surprised to see so many little screens lighting up and a group of people talking throughout a recent showing of Jordan Peele’s horror-thriller Us. I do NOT blame these people for needing to reduce their anxiety.

In Us, Lupita Nyong’o plays the mother in a family of four on vacation at a beach house. One night, the family wakes up to find four shadowy figures standing in their driveway, and, not long after, this becomes a terrifying home invasion. Far more disturbing than even that is the fact that the mysterious invaders look essentially exactly like Nyong’o and her family, except that there is something very, drastically wrong with them.

Beyond that, it’s best I don’t say, because you should know as little as possible going in. But I can say that between this and 2017’s Oscar-winning Get Out, Peele has shown himself to be an expert director of horror and suspense. He plays within the genre while avoiding clichés, his shot compositions are both beautiful and designed to make us uneasy, and he knows where to place a few well timed jokes so the extreme tension of the movie is maintained without making the whole thing feel oppressively punishing. Peele understands what scares us on a visceral level, and he knows it’s not just gore or silly surprises—often, what really scares us already lies within us.

If Us contains a subtext of social commentary, it’s far less overt than it was in Get Out. In fact, I’ve read at least half a dozen reasonably compelling theories of what Peele is saying with this movie, including relating it to Jungian psychology, our current political climate, and seeing it as an indictment of Reagan-era social policies. I won’t tell you what I think, because part of the importance here is thinking through it yourself, but the movie is wide open to interpretation, and any one of the many theories could be true.

Or, none of them could be true. Us works incredibly well just as a horror movie: it’s genuinely frightening and has images that will burn themselves into your brain. The movie’s not without its flaws—it’s not particularly internally consistent, and one twist was a bridge too far for me, but none of this detracts from the full experience, and besides, the best advice I got before heading to the theater was just not to think too hard about it.

And though horror, as a genre, is shamefully overlooked when it comes to awards season, one exception for this movie may be Lupita Nyong’o, who has every chance at an Oscar nomination for Us. She’s extraordinary in her dual role as both the mother and her terrifying doppelganger, expressing resolve and vulnerability alongside searing homicidal anger and traumatic distress. Us is an intense, powerful, and unsettling ordeal that will not lead you by the hand to any conclusions, but will force you to take a very hard look at who we really are.",AP_Doc4_Us,AP,Horror,Positive,Us_2019
164,AP_Doc5_Us,"I would love to be able to say that Jordan Peele’s Us is a worthy follow-up to his fantastic directorial debut Get Out, but I’m afraid I just can’t. After a genuinely creepy first half, the film very quickly devolves into tedium and over-explanation. It feels directionless, as though Peele created a fantastic horror scenario that he didn’t know what to do with. As such, the film plods along, repeating the same beats over and over, until Peele decides somewhat arbitrarily to just get it over with. 

The story involves a family vacationing at their summer home in Santa Cruz. Endearingly-clueless father, Gabe (Winston Duke), attempts to connect with his kids, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex), while his wife, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), becomes increasingly agitated. She has a traumatic history with the nearby beach boardwalk and doesn’t want her own children to be hurt, as well. Things quickly spiral out of control, though, as their home is invaded by another family that looks exactly like them. 

It is during these moments – as the family is coming to grips with the surreal situation they’re in – that the film excels. Peele shows himself more than capable of ratcheting up the tension until we just can’t take it anymore. However, as he starts to widen the scope of the story, more explanation is needed to make sense of these strange goings-on. Peele does try to keep things interesting with the occasional action set piece, but it all begins to feel perfunctory and repetitive. Eventually, I found myself losing interest to the point that I genuinely no longer cared about what I was watching.

The actors are not to blame here. Every member of the cast is quite capable, though I do wish that many of them were given more to do. We get a general idea of who the kids are, but we never truly feel like we know them. And Gabe isn’t really explored beyond the superficial “dorky dad” archetype. It is only the character of Adelaide that we are allowed to get to know, and Lupita Nyong’o perfectly captures the character’s strength and emotional fragility. She is palpably frightened throughout the film, yet is able to muster up a very realistic courage that never denies that fear, but simply fights through it. Adelaide is an interesting character, and Nyong’o’s performance carries the film.

With such a game cast and haunting tone, I just wish that the film had amounted to more. Being confronted with one’s own doppelgänger is a tried-and-true horror premise, and a deeply effective one, because it invites the audience to examine the darker aspects of itself. But it has to remain an intimate affair, lest it become impersonal and generic. Sadly, by broadening the story, it becomes less specific to these characters and their issues and begins to feel more like the director is pontificating, actively rejecting story in favor of theme. 

It is possible to make such choices work, but I don’t think Peele quite knows how yet. Horror is a tricky genre, which can allow a filmmaker to explore all manner of cultural, psychological, and political themes. But it needs to be balanced just right, or else key elements get lost. And I think Us loses its sense of urgency the bigger it gets.

Peele seems to realize this, and he decides to bring the story back to Adelaide as she grapples with her traumatic past. It’s a smart move, but one that is undercut by a reveal that is lifted straight out of Treehouse of Horror on The Simpsons, and made all the more eye-rolling because it is in no way a surprise. While Nyong’o does her best to give this moment weight, she can’t quite overcome the inherent shrug of such a non-revelation. 

This isn’t to say that Us is totally irredeemable. There is plenty of style and mood to suggest that Jordan Peele continues to have a bright future as a filmmaker. Unfortunately, when comparing this film to his stellar debut, I’m not quite as excited for his next film as I was for this one, and that bright future has begun to dim ever so slightly. ",AP_Doc5_Us,AP,Horror,Negative,Us_2019
165,AP_Doc6_Us,"As a skeptic of Jordan Peele, I felt enormous satisfaction watching Us (Us, 2019). Not only does it seem less than ¡Huye! (Get Out, 2017), but lacks even a single formidable image like that of Daniel Kaluuya submerged within his own consciousness. There will be those who differ before the rise of a gif taken from Us where a girl's face fills with terror, but although the use of colors has a certain originality, it does not seem enough to me to compensate for the many shortcomings of the film. On the contrary, the image alone in a film that is illogical, incoherent and abundant in common places should affirm the disbelief of many before the director. This is not to say that Peele has no talent at all or an aesthetic identity, but it does mean that I disbelieve his potential and his status as a great contemporary author.

From the beginning of the film, one perceives Peele's imagination: a commercial for a human network that was made in 1986 to combat poverty in the United States is advertised on a television. It is a social element that alludes to the theme of the film: the privilege and the uprising of the forgotten. Later we see a girl and her family in a dark amusement park, which would be subtly threatening were it not for the clumsy and carefree nature of the father. A distraction from him allows the girl to escape to a house of mirrors where Peele raises the much-seen conflict between madness and the paranormal when an identical girl appears to the protagonist. Is the double real or just an illusion in the mirror? The question is diluted when, many years later, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) returns to town with her husband — just as stupid as her father — and their children. One night a family identical to them appears at their house, and with it begins a story that starts from the fantastic but later turns out to have scientific explanations. Questioned only a little, they fall apart and a whimsical plot is discovered that ends up undermining Peele's ideas.

I don't think I'm exposing the plot by saying that the invading family is a metaphor for the downtrodden on Earth — or at least on American soil. While the protagonists have had a more or less normal life, their doubles are shadows who live the same circumstances but in a bloody tone. For example, if one Adelaide had a healthy delivery, the other was torn without anesthesia. This refers to a country where certain people have access to a quality health system because they can afford it, while others are thrown to their fate because universal health is considered a communist evil. Is that why the stuntmen wear red? In my opinion there are no elements to help us define it. Rather, the decision seems to be due to Peele's taste for intense color contrasts, that is to say: another whim.

In this sense, there is a revealing scene that, although it seeks to show the influence of Steven Spielberg, only exposes Peele's limited imagination and explains much of the failure of the film. On a beach, Adelaide and her family hang out with her friends, the Tylers, a group of whites even more idiots than her husband. Before getting to the point, I would like to celebrate Peele's subversion of stereotypes, since, if in traditional horror the black character is the first to die, here are others who are condemned; If the foolish bride causes her own death, here the inept husband is the one who always ends up being ridiculed. Getting back to the point, a character is wearing a Jaws T-shirt (Jaws, 1975) while Peele tries to pay homage to Spielberg's Hitchcockian scene in which a child is eaten, However, the young director does not have the formal tools of the old man, who links the characters by placing them in different spaces within a painting and uses the retrozoom in one of his most memorable examples. Peele only imitates Spielberg's plane-counterplane to generate tension. Not to mention the holes in the plot that I suggested earlier and that I prefer the viewer to question on their own, or the strange tone that varies between the massacre and the jokes about popular culture.

In general, Jordan Peele is relevant for being an African-American director who uses genre cinema to expose important issues, but his aesthetic is not particularly original, like that of Spike Lee or Boots Riley - although he is slightly subversive in terms of racial roles. nor are its subjects discussed in great depth. We exemplify this better than Run away! And that's why it satisfies me in the suspicion that I felt from that first movie. I wish the culture would turn with the same appreciation towards Riley, a true subversive storyteller.",AP_Doc6_Us,AP,Horror,Negative,Us_2019
166,AP_Doc7_Us,"Us, Jordan Peele’s follow up to his excellent Oscar-winning debut Get Out, is a go-for-broke ambitious mess of a film. I found myself thinking Peele’s two films are akin to Ridley Scott’s Alien and Prometheus; the former is a fresh, thematically-rich and chilling horror film with a simple-yet-terrifying premise (both Get Out and Alien are riffs on the haunted house trope) while the latter is just batshit crazy in the best possible way. It’s as if Peele had a big brainstorming session with a smorgasbord of ideas, then decided to include every single one of them in Us.

Us opens with a traumatic childhood event for Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong’o): in 1986, on the Santa Cruz beachfront, she wandered away from her parents for 15 minutes into an abandoned house of mirrors and saw a girl that looked exactly like her. Fast forward to a few decades later, and the adult Adelaide is headed to Santa Cruz again, this time with her husband Gabe (Winston Duke) and her two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex). A typical upper-class suburban family, they head to their beach house to relax and unwind. They meet up with their uppity wealthy friends, Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker) and their twin teenage daughters, Becca and Lindsey (Cali and Noelle Sheldon). When Jason briefly disappears at the beach–coincidentally in the same carnival house of mirrors from Adelaide’s past–and witnesses a strange figure standing with arms outstretched on the sand, it leaves Adelaide deeply unsettled.

When darkness falls, Us turns into a home invasion film with a twist: the four red-jumpsuit-clad invaders standing out on the driveway are exact doppelgängers of the Wilson family. Let by the mother, Red (also played by Nyong’o), the new family’s movements and demeanor are decidedly off and creepy; their stiff-yet-swift movements, unblinking stares, and deadly sharp golden scissors are all quite intimidating. When the two families are finally face to face, Gabe asks the question on everyone’s mind: “Who are you people?” To which Red calmly responds: “We’re Americans.”

Now, in my UK theatre, this line elicited a huge uproar of laughter. Indeed, Us is darkly hilarious, a genuine comedy as much as a horror film, and I laughed quite a bit throughout the final half. Though gruesomely violent at times, Us is not particularly scary, mostly due to the pacing and shot placement. Peele chooses to show us quite a bit of Red and her family (as well as other, future invaders), opting for an unsettled feeling rather than jump scares or outright dread and terror. If you simply accept its ridiculous premise and allow the jokes to set the tone, Us is quite a bit of wacky horrific fun.

Metaphors work well when they’re simple. This is not to say that there is a one-to-one correspondence of meaning, a This=That formula–true metaphors can elicit a polyvalence of legitimate interpretations and ideas–but rather that the symbol or sign doesn’t require huge explantations to discern its meaning and significance. This is especially true for horror; keep it simple, smart, and scary, and the symbolism will work wonders. This is precisely why Get Out worked so well: the Sunken Place was about white supremacy and racism, sure, but it was also about so much more than that–capitalism, classism, modern aesthetics, sexuality and gender, police and security, even social media. It kept us talking about the problems in our nation, the things that make us uncomfortable or angry, the beliefs and systems which are both ubiquitous and oppressive. Us gets us talking about how and why the doppelgängers eat bunnies.

Which is fine. Horror films–or any films for that matter–don’t have to be philosophically rigorous or culturally stimulating to be good art or entertainment. The problem is that Us wants to tease us with all its supposed symbolism, to provoke us to ask why? even as the film doesn’t really care about offering a coherent answer or making a sensible statement on The Way Things Are. Us is about capitalism, politics, ideology, racism, classism, sexism, religion, bunnies, California, boating, bunnies, Black Flag, still more bunnies, the “Hands Across America” event of 1986, the weird culture of beachfront theme parks, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, Cartesian dualism, the fashion faux pas of wearing Crocs, and the peril of running with scissors.

It’s also about the Bible. A grungy drifter carrying a cardboard sign with “Jeremiah 11:11” is a repeated image, albeit it’s difficult to discern how this is important to the events in the narrative (though I imagine it’ll make folks look up the verse after the film). In a climactic, balletic confrontation between Adelaide and Red–a beautiful sequence where image, sound, and performances all come together in cinematic perfection, a moment which is perhaps one of my favorite scenes I’ve ever seen in a horror film–the doppelgänger tells her twin in a De Palma-esque split diopter shot that it was God who brought them together back in 1986. I don’t know what God has to do with any of this; I’m not sure Peele quite knows (or cares) either. The final “twist” is so obvious and such a cheat to the entire earlier narrative that it undermines any potential message or meaning Peele might be attempting to communicate. In short, Us (both the film and the nation) is kind of a big silly mess which makes little coherent sense, yet I feel a certain fondness for it. Maybe I can’t help it; I’m American.",AP_Doc7_Us,AP,Horror,Negative,Us_2019
167,AP_Doc8_Us,"The title of Toni Morrison’s new essay collection, The Source of Self-Regard, indicates what should be the point of the horror-comedy Us, if Us had a point. Morrison figures out the roots of identity, personal awareness, and artistic ambition. Through 43 compositions mostly about race, reprinted without original dates and bound in a subtly defiant pink jacket, the Nobel prize winner reintroduces herself to the woke generation. Morrison’s examples of belles lettres contradict Jordan Peele’s low-brow Hollywood-backed hucksterism, yet she addresses the generation that Hollywood has learned to control, especially in this moment, when “inclusion” and “diversity” are little more than marketing strategies. How better to sell Black Lives Matter tickets than by calling a movie “Us”?

*   *   *

The actors who portray the besieged black family in Us were obviously cast for their dark skin tone. Writer-director Peele apparently likes the political horror-comedy frisson of colorism, using Lupita Nyong’o (Patsey in 12 Years a Slave) and Winston Duke (M’Baku in Black Panther) the same way he cast Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out — as ultra-blacks. This nontraditional Hollywood casting is more than counterintuitive; it’s a specious form of authenticity. Peele emphasizes racial difference — taunting it — but without Morrison’s in-depth exploration.

During 1970s blaxploitation, filmmakers exploited black beauty by eroticizing dark-skin actresses such as Brenda Sykes, Gloria Hendry, Judy Pace, Mae Mercer; and photographer-turned-director Gordon Parks cast former model Richard Roundtree as ebony-hard detective Shaft. It might seem impolite to bring all this up, but it’s important to grasp actor-comedian Peele’s temerity, which has been taken seriously since his 2017 hit Get Out won acclaim for treating race as a visual joke.

Peele exploits race without owning up to the manipulation. Showcasing his actors’ surface physiognomy is part of an insidious ploy, often used by race-hustling politicians, that Peele himself probably doesn’t completely understand. Inadvertently, his movies follow the lineage of black movie caricatures without improving them: Coal-black Nyong’o and Duke are PC exaggerations of the black American phenotype. When they get bug-eyed, just as 1930–’40s comic actors Willie Best and Mantan Moreland did, Peele’s audience is signaled to not only laugh but be frightened. Fear is Peele’s idea of cultural progress.

*   *   *

Us pretends to critique black social progress via horror-comedy shtick. Nyong’o and Duke play bourgeois couple Adelaide and Gabe Wilson — artistic, proper-speaking, and unappealing yuppies (buppies) who, along with their TV-commercial-styled children Zora and Jason, vacation at a fashionable beach town. The exclusivity of the Wilsons’ upscale retreat is violated by crazed mutants — freak-show doppelgängers who attack the family, seeking revenge for reasons unspecified beyond haves-vs.-have-nots. (Peele’s contrived explanation is ludicrous.)

The Wilson family’s travail indicates race guilt (not the all-American dystopia of Brian Taylor’s horror-comedy Mom and Dad). Yet there isn’t a single moment of empathy between the characters — only hysteria as the Wilsons attempt to survive with their privilege intact. Peele depicts this struggle superficially and incoherently, as he did in Get Out. He knows that race makes people’s heads spin. Add bludgeoning musical effects, an illogical, sub–Twilight Zone premise, plus bloodshed, and critics will genuflect, taking Peele’s manipulation to be sociologically profound.

But thrill-ride gimmicks that distract from the concept’s incoherence expose Peele’s essential non-seriousness. His beach scene incompetently mimics Jaws, and his pop-music references are dubious: The Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” is used during ironic Tarantino mayhem, and Peele proves his cultural ignorance when he misses the chance to underscore a call for the police with “Roxanne,” the song by British rock band The Police that Eddie Murphy wailed and subverted in 48 Hrs. Instead, Peele blares N.W.A.’s “F*** tha Police.” Yawn.

This film’s doppelgängers — inarticulate, dressed like convicts, and carrying gold shears — claim that they are “tethered” to the Wilsons. “We’re Americans!” they announce, then inflict imprisonment (beatings and handcuffs) like specters from Ava DuVernay’s prison-industrial-complex fetish. In pale imitation of the classic horror-film concept of “the return of the repressed,” a neighboring white family (headed by PC standard-bearer Elisabeth Moss) is also beset by replicant ghouls. Peele attempts to revive the discredited “post-racial” notion from 2008. But political reality outstrips his comedy routine. Us runs up against the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) movement, which isn’t founded on fright-movie terms but insists on confronting the horrific past without make-believe.

Black social fears are not alleviated through the teasing and mockery seen in Us; only clueless viewers would think so, and they turn out to be the audience most susceptible to Peele’s race-based conceits.

Critics have praised Us as a satire on class envy, especially black upward mobility, yet Candace Owens lays waste to Peele’s “post-racial” folly with her suggestion that the recent bureaucratic exoneration of Jussie Smollett “destroyed the myth of white privilege.” The Wilsons may be dark-skinned, but they’re the whitest-acting movie characters ever seen on screen. The “class” charade substitutes for Peele’s inability to grasp the lingering effects of slavery or see through the phoniness of Peele’s race-baiting. His notion of being “tethered” to mutants suckers white liberals just as the “sunken place” notion suckered disconcerted blacks struggling with their own unarticulated miseries. They’re being preached at by a bad comic who specializes in ridiculing black pathology.

*   *   *

Interpreting Peele’s silliness — early nods to The Man with Two Brains, C.H.U.D., and The Goonies — doesn’t go beyond his trivializing black American deprivation into junk-movie entertainment. And no intelligent moviegoer should be impressed by his tonier affectations, which are mere sketch comedy. He starts Us with a prologue of preteen Adelaide wearing a Michael Jackson Thriller T-shirt, wandering off from her parents at a carnival in 1986. She winds up in a “Find Yourself” haunted-house attraction where she sees her likeness in a mirror — it’s the back of a little black girl’s head, evoking René Magritte’s 1937 painting Not to Be Reproduced.

Given the political funhouse that the United States has become since 2008, Peele’s obsidian mirror goes no deeper than a carnival hoax. It’s the same game as Viola Davis and Cynthia Erivo staring face to face like Ibo vs. Dahomey statues in Steve McQueen’s Widows — a middlebrow art affectation such as the 1980s black gallery exhibitions Toni Morrison critiques in her essay “Harlem on My Mind: Contesting Memory — Meditation on Museums, Culture, and Integration.”

The woke generation that Morrison pursues is not more literate than their ancestors who read Morrison’s Beloved. (Some of them even appreciated Jonathan Demme’s bold film adaptation, which others scoffed at as a black version of The Exorcist.) But gullible responses to Get Out and Us show that woke viewers outsmart themselves and are cinema illiterate, and Hollywood knows a surefire way to trick-or-treat them: Under the horror-movie rubric, the woke generation will fall for anything. From here on, I will no longer refer to Jordan Peele as a race hustler. Us proves he is something simpler: a charlatan.",AP_Doc8_Us,AP,Horror,Negative,Us_2019
168,AP_Doc9_Us,"Hot from 2017 hit Get Out, comedian-turned-director Jordan Peele is back in the horror playhouse, confirming his preternatural, studied mastery of the genre. Forget the presumptive denial of terms of “elevated” and “post-horror” – Us is a true genre flick, polished to a fine degree, a pure distillation of the essence of horror cinema.

From the opening sequence, it’s clear that this is a different beast to Get Out. Where that film favoured a slow burn, gradually ratcheting up the tension to find the horror in its final act, here the terror is unleashed from the start. The creepy, oppressive score from Michael Abels and Michael Gioulakis’ rich, expressionistic cinematography work to create an unambiguous atmosphere of dread; an aspect of horror that is often forgotten is that it can be deeply pleasurable. Coming from comedy – another genre routinely discarded by critics for eliciting physiological responses in its audience – Peele has an inherent understanding of the pleasure in terror and its relationship to humour. The result of this understanding is an experience that is both deeply suspenseful and aesthetically lush.

Opening in 1986 during the ‘hands across America’ campaign, a young Adelaide (Madison Curry) wanders off from her dad at a carnival, on to the beach to find a hall of mirrors. It’s a classic genre trope, recalling the trashy pleasures of cult film Malatesta’s Carnival of Blood as much as the distorted spaces of silent classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Inside the hall, Adelaide is met with her double in a delightfully creepy image. Years later, Adelaide is married with two children. Desptie her protestations, her husband (fellow Black Panther alumnus Winston Duke) insists on returning to the beach for a family vacation. Eerie coincidences begin to mount – like a frisbee landing perfectly in the circle of a beach towel – hearkening the return of the mirror girl.

And return she does, bringing with her a terrible brood, an inverse of the Wilson family. Where the Wilsons are respectable, middle class Americans, their mirrors are singularly monstrous, their movements uncannily graceful, mute save for animalistic howls and grunts. The exception is the Other Adelaide, speaking in tortured inhalations, as she recounts her bizarre fairy-tale story. Truly, Nyong’o’s dual-turn as Adelaide and ‘Red’ is astonishing in its balancing of empathy and unadulterated terror.

It’s clear that as a director, Peele’s cinema is steeped in the history of horror – for those looking, German expressionist cinema, Night of the Living Dead, Italian giallo and The Stepford Wives are but some of the imprints to be found in the fabric of his work. But two films in, it’s Peele’s fixation on the human face that is truly fascinating. Repeating his trick from Get Out of having his characters look directly into the camera, wide-eyed, often weeping, in dread, awe, menace or a mixture of all three. If the number one rule in horror is to never show the monster, Peele gleefully breaks it, forcing his characters and his audience to gaze directly into its face. Perhaps what is most terrifying is the humanity that stares back.",AP_Doc9_Us,AP,Horror,Positive,Us_2019
169,AP_Doc10_Us,"The rule of horror films is that they start with low budgets for a higher profit ratio than your “normal” blockbuster. Get Out was a wildly successful movie, and so Jordan Peele was given more than four times as much money to make Us — and that budget is still minuscule by comparison to a blockbuster. They say there’s no longer such a thing as a mid-budget film, but modern horror may well be it. Us is more overt horror than Get Out ever was, and plays its hand much sooner, but it immediately points out that, as a writer/director, Jordan Peele knows more than one trick.

Adelaide Wilson (Lupita Nyong’o, Black Panther) is at her family’s summer house with husband Gabe (Duke Winston, Avengers: Infinity War), daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph, TV’s Hairspray Live!) and son Jason (Evan Alex). Her feeling that something is about to go very wrong comes true when what seems like a home invasion turns out to be something even more sinister: the invaders all look exactly like the Wilson family, lead by spokeswoman Red (Nyong’o). Adelaide and her family have to escape their summer home and Red’s family.

Peele sets Us’ tone with a dark beginning on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk circa The Lost Boys. It is immediately apparent that Peele has a keen eye for Us’ aesthetic, and with cinematographer Mike Gioulakis (Glass) he has crafted a distinctive film. The use of lighting and colour throughout is superb, and characters sliding in and out of visibility and interpretation create an ambiguity that permeates the film from beginning to end. Though the script and the cinematography inform each other in Us, practically any shot taken in isolation is art in itself.

Us taps into primal fears, not of the other but of the same. It is frequently unsettling, not simply for the acts of violence but the anticipation of same. The Wilson family get few opportunities to breathe, and have to be constantly on guard, and Peele affords this lack of luxury to the audience. Us has no comedy elements, and is only passably funny; the writing and direction focus on the propulsion of the situation and the characters’ confusion, which we have no choice but to share. There is a constant sense of dread afforded by Us, but it is not too brutal for the horror uninitiated to consume.

Us is a high-concept film, and one that does not explain everything. Whether it explains too much is another matter, and there is endless room for debate in particular about the necessity of the opening crawl. The ability of Peele to provide in-depth exposition on some aspects of his story and leave others is deliberate and frustrating, and part of Us’ charm. We know too much and too little, and we are left only with hypotheses that may never be answered.

Despite the aesthetic and thematic work entered into by Peele, Us thrives on the strength of its performances. Each cast member has a doubled role, and although Peele has again at least partially cast a film based on its actors’ ability to produce incredibly creepy smiles on command, they don’t feel as if they are simply appearing on-screen twice in each scene. The Wilsons are all strong, as are Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid’s Tale) and Tim Heidecker (Ant-Man and the Wasp) as their rival friends, but Us belongs to Nyong’o. She brings an intense physicality and an urgency to both Adelaide and Red, and the enmity that she displays towards herself is palpable. That you can root for one character and against another in the same shot, in the same scene, in the same actress, is something that goes beyond mere camera trickery. 

Us is a deeply political movie with a message far less overt than Get Out; viewers are welcome to watch it entirely from a pure horror movie perspective if they so wish, but it is difficult not to see the underlying messages here. Either viewing it on a surface level or tunnelling deep into its mythos, Us is a richly composed film that succeeds on every level. Even its more contentious elements are still a sign of the victory that Peele exerts over the cinema-goer.

Based on the Japanese novel, Ringu, and a remake of the 1998 Hideo Nakata Japanese film of the same name written by Hiroshi Takahashi, The Ring is the story of a mysterious videotape that kills each of its viewers seven days after seeing the tape. Watch the tape, the phone rings and an ominous voice tells you that you will die. Wait a week and then die. Piece of cake.or so it seems.
As luck would have it, a young teenaged girl named Katie who has a journalist for an aunt, dies after seeing the tape, sending her aunt into investigative mode as to the cause of Katies death. Initially Aunt Rachel views the alleged myth of the tape with great cynicism and skepticism, but after suffering nightmares and some bizarre physical symptoms, not to mention realizing that her young son has viewed the tape, she begins to believe that there is something evil going on here and there just may be some truth to the legacy and age old horror stories.
The tape itself is masterfully eerie and bizarre  grainy, sepia-toned and black & white footage depicting a collection of images seemingly compiled from the worst nightmares of the world  writhing maggots, burning trees (not bushes), covered cisterns, stormy nights, dead creatures, dismembered yet moving fingers and a ring-like tunneling vision like the eye of a tornado. And of course, strange visions of people and places which with a bit of video technology and good old fashioned detective work, prove to be key to the tape and is mysteries.
With only five days to go until D-Day after her viewing the tape, Rachel embarks on a full scale investigation together with her ex-boyfriend and father of her son, Noah, taking her into the woods of the Pacific Northwest and deep into the horrors of the once well-to-do Morgan family.
Naomi Watts stars as Rachel. Unfortunately, her bright beginning in the film rapidly reduces to that of a dim and flickering bulb as her performance gets increasingly erratic before settling into the mindless banality of the zombies in the campiest horror films ever made. A talented actress, I have to believe that her performance (or lack thereof) is due to the Ehren Krugers poor script and Gore Verbinskis even worse directing. Martin Henderson seems aptly cast as the non-committal/non-family man, Noah, a character that we really dont expect that much from and thus, are actually pleasantly surprised at some of the development the character actually does make. David Dorfman as young Aidan Keller, is impressive but it seems as if Verbinski tried to make him into a clone of Haley Joel Osment in his Sixth Sense starring role. Sorry guys  it didnt work. Dorfman has always been engaging in his recurring television performances on Family Law and perhaps television is where he should remain for awhile longer. Well find out next month when he heads up the cast of the much anticipated A Wrinkle In Time based on the time-honored Caldecott award winning book by Madeline LEngle.
Director Gore Verbinski, best known for Mouse Hunt and The Mexican (and next up The Pirates of the Caribbean) has proven he has talent, although going from Mouse Hunt to The Mexican and now to The Ring it seems to be steadily deteriorating. He uses Hitchcockian techniques of close-ups on inanimate objects and creepy crawly flying things (including some birds) very artfully and effectively to create tension, but then cant carry over these small nuances to the big picture to scare the pants off you. Instead, he loses the story and the audience and gets a laugh instead of a collective terrifying gasp or shriek.
Although visually stimulating, cinematographer Bojan Bazelli cant save the film from its own idiocy as the story goes from the bad to worse and finally becomes ridiculously absurd  which accounts for the almost non-stop chortling of the audience.
This is a film that screams stop already at the 30 minute mark, yet like the Energizer Bunny (but nowhere near as cute), it keeps going and going and going and going to excess. Writer Ehren Kruger, who previously brought us Scream 3 and Reindeer Games (the latter of which also had explanation upon explanation contained throughout) clearly has a penchant for wanting to be mysterious (and in this case, creepy) yet explain away all the mystery. Unfortunately, he doesnt know understand the less is more concept  especially in the supernatural fright flick.
A horrifically terrifying film-going experience  to be sure. A horrifically terrifying film? No way. The only thing possibly worse than actually watching The Ring will be paying the late fees when it goes to video and it takes you seven days just to view it.",JP_Doc1_TheRing,JP,Horror,Negative,The Ring
171,JP_Doc2_TheRing,"With Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, Brian Cox. Directed by Gore Verbinski. Running time: 109 mins. Rated PG-13: drug and alcohol content, sexuality, some violence and language. 1 1/2 Stars. The imagination of Salvador Dali meets the supernatural hustle of M. Night Shyamalan in Gore Verbinski's ""The Ring,"" a horror ghost story that figures to become a cult film for the video generation. I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror - the fear of the VCR! - that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks. It's already generating ""Blair Witch"" buzz on the Internet. Adapted from both a series of Japanese novels and the Japanese film, TV and comic-book franchise they spawned, ""The Ring"" is certainly the strangest movie to come out of a Hollywood studio (DreamWorks) this year. It's an art-house B movie with philosophical pretensions, a murky story line and a disturbing, sequel-promising ending. A terrific lead performance from Aussie actress Naomi Watts, who emerged as a potential star in David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive,"" is about the only thing I enjoyed about it. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a Seattle newspaper reporter and single mom, whose investigation into the death of a teenage niece puts her and her young son's life in jeopardy. In the film's long tease opening, the niece dies of a heart attack exactly seven days after watching a strange videotape and receiving a telephone call giving her a week to live. Ace reporter that she is, Rachel retraces her niece's steps to a wooded motel cabin where she finds the haunted video, and pops it into the VCR for her own viewing pleasure. It's a weird, symbolism-rich short, something you'd see at a festival of bad student films, with Dali-esque images suggesting family tragedy on a horse farm next to the sea. Having received her ""death call,"" Rachel enlists the aid of Noah (New Zealander Martin Henderson), a video expert who happens to be her ex-boyfriend and the father of her psychic son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Of course, he watches it and gets a telephone call himself. Then, Aidan, after sneaking a peek in the middle of a sleepless night, gets his call. ""The Ring"" follows Rachel and Noah as they race the clock to deconstruct the video and take away its power. Their clues are provided mostly by Aidan, who is channeling the ghost of a young girl in the video. Verbinski - who directed the Brad Pitt/Julia Roberts fiasco, ""The Mexican"" - is a fine visual stylist, and ""The Ring,"" shot in the rain and mist of the Pacific Northwest, is deftly atmospheric and genuinely creepy. The editing, full of quick cuts and foreboding, is hip enough for a music video. While ""The Ring"" is a contextual dead ringer for the recent ""FearDotCom"" (sub the video with a Web site), the movie it most resembles in spirit is David Cronenberg's far superior ""Videodrome,"" about a late-night TV program that infects the minds of its viewers. The hallucinatory quality of that film's imagery continues to haunt me, in ways ""The Ring"" never will. But the subsequent video revolution deserves its own benchmark horror film, which the Japanese version, ""Ringu,"" is among Asians, and which Verbinski's could become in the West. ""Ringu,"" by the way, screens next weekend at the Walter Reade Theater, as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center series ""Scary Movies: 30 Years of Horror,"" which begins today.

172,JP_Doc3_TheRing,"We've always known that watching certain movies on video is guaranteed to kill brain cells. But ""The Ring"" takes that certainty and pushes it to an intriguing extreme -- that watching one particularly cursed videotape will quite literally kill the watcher.
It's a cool idea for a horror movie and one that Japanese novelist Suzuki Koji, said to be his country's Stephen King, covered amply in his book, ""Ringu,"" which was made into a highly successful 1998 movie by Hideo Nakata, which in turn spawned a run of Japanese horror movies concerned with the deadly power of modern technology.
Now comes the inevitable Hollywood take on the gimmick, a fairly literal reading of the material called ""The Ring,"" by the apparently gimmick-obsessed director Gore Verbinski (""Mouse Hunt,"" ""The Mexican""). It's an effectively creepy and insinuating treatment, but one that eventually feels like an endless variation on a one-note idea.
The macabre idea is this: urban legend around the high-school hallways has it that there exists a haunted videotape that will bring certain death within seven days to anyone who views it.
We're quickly introduced to an all-American teen named Katie (Amber Tamblyn, the daughter of actor Russ Tamblyn), who naturally has watched the tape with a bunch of friends and alternately giggled and shivered at the danger. But -- yikes! -- right after they watched it, the teens received a terrifying phone call with an ominous voice saying, ""You will die in seven days."" A week later, they've all been ghoulishly dispatched to the big Blockbuster in the sky.
Enter Katie's curious cousin and intrepid Seattle newspaper reporter, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts, the fine actress from David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive""), who vows to look into the tragedy and get the real scoop.
So she does what any self-respecting reporter would do -- she goes to a remote cabin in the woods and watches the videotape herself, along with her ex-boyfriend, Noah (Martin Henderson), and -- in what must be a backhand slap at the wishy-washy MPAA rating system -- her own small son, Aidan (David Dorfman).
The videotape itself is a mishmash of bizarre images -- of swarming maggots and corpses floating in the surf, of deep wells and women staring placidly into mirrors, of strange men peeking into windows and other surreal stuff.
When the lights come on, Rachel is faced with a chilling deadline -- either solve the mystery in a week's time, or die (needless to say, an editor's dream). The rest is fairly standard thriller material, with Rachel creeping up on the solution in fits and starts, and with Verbinski pouring on the atmospherics of dread and teasing out clues at a maddeningly slow pace.
Trouble is, the slow pace gives us too much time to think about the story's lapses in logic. And Verbinski's style is so conventional that the various scare devices and horror images he throws on the screen feel oddly more comforting than frightening. At least he delivers everything audiences expect -- albeit with little that's truly original or truly terrifying.
""The Ring"" is an idea that demands audiences lose themselves in the far-out fantasy. But this fantasy is too grounded in Hollywood convention to really lift us out of our seats in fright. Perhaps when it's released on videotape, the movie might find a willing cult audience of dedicated ironists and then achieve some of its promised potency.

173,JP_Doc4_TheRing,"Rarely has a more serious effort produced a less serious result than in ""The Ring,"" the kind of dread dark horror film where you better hope nobody in the audience snickers, because the film teeters right on the edge of the ridiculous.

Enormous craft has been put into the movie, which looks just great, but the story goes beyond contrivance into the dizzy realms of the absurd. And although there is no way for everything to be explained (and many events lack any possible explanation), the movie's ending explains and explains and explains, until finally you'd rather just give it a pass than sit through one more tedious flashback.

The story involves a video that brings certain death. You look at it, the phone rings, and you find out you have seven days to live. A prologue shows some teenage victims of the dread curse, and then newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) gets on the case, helped by eerie drawings by her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman).

The story has been recycled from a popular Japanese thriller by Hideo Nakata, which was held off the market in this country to clear the field for this remake. Alas, the same idea was ripped off in August by ""feardotcom,"" also a bad movie, but more plain fun than ""The Ring,"" and with a climax that used brilliant visual effects while this one drags on endlessly.

I dare not reveal too much of the story but will say that the video does indeed bring death in a week, something we are reminded of as Rachel tries to solve the case while titles tick off the days. A single mom, she enlists Aidan's father, a video geek named Noah (Martin Henderson) to analyze the deadly tape. He tags along for the adventure, which inevitably leads to their learning to care for one another, I guess, although the movie is not big on relationships. Her investigation leads her to a remote cottage on an island and to the weird, hostile man (Brian Cox) who lives there. And then the explanations start to pile up.

This is Naomi Watts' first move since ""Mulholland Drive"" and I was going to complain that we essentially learn nothing about her character except that she's a newspaper reporter--but then I remembered that in ""Mulholland Drive"" we essentially learned nothing except that she was a small-town girl in Hollywood, and by the end of the movie we weren't even sure we had learned that. ""Mulholland Drive,"" however, evoked juicy emotions and dimensions that ""The Ring"" is lacking, and involved us in a puzzle that was intriguing instead of simply tedious.

There are a couple of moments when we think ""The Ring"" is going to end, and it doesn't. One is that old reliable where the heroine, soaking wet and saved from death, says ""I want to go home,"" and the hero cushions her head on his shoulder. But no, there's more. Another is when Aidan says, ""You didn't let her out, did you?"" That would have been a nice ironic closer, but the movie spells out the entire backstory in merciless detail, until when we're finally walking out of the theater, we're almost ashamed to find ourselves wondering, hey, who was that on the phone?",JP_Doc4_TheRing,JP,Horror,Negative,The Ring
174,JP_Doc5_TheRing,"To describe The Ring, two adjectives leap to mind: spooky and lame. The former refers to the tone and atmosphere, which are about as good as it gets for a ghost story. The latter refers to the storyline, which is about as poorly constructed as can be imagined  a sad amalgamation of irritating contrivances and gaping plot holes that defy even a generous attempt to suspend disbelief. And, while I normally appreciate open-ended motion pictures, The Ring takes things too far by leaving about 75% of its questions unanswered. This isn't an artistic choice; it's screenwriting sloppiness, and it results in a profoundly dissatisfying experience.
I knew the moment I exited The Ring that I didn't like the movie, but the gloomy atmosphere is so seductive that it took me a while to realize why. The problem lies in the storytelling. The Ring is an incoherent mess, and the more you reflect upon it, the less credible it becomes. (Note: I'm using the word ""credible"" within the context of the horror/ghost story genre.) The movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense. The twist ending feels like something grafted on, and it left me with a question about which was more absurd  the revelation discovered by the main character or the manner in which she makes the discovery.
People who are easily unsettled by ghost stories will be freaked out by The Ring. Director Gore Verbinski has studied the masters and understands exactly what it takes to create the perfect ""boo!"" moment. The loud noise, the sudden movement, the musical stinger  they're all there, and Verbinski employs them with enough skill to apply the ""gotcha!"" to even the most jaded, veteran horror fanatic a time or two. Unfortunately, that's about all this movie has going for it  quick, cheap thrills. The Ring is a remake of a Japanese movie that I have not seen. Fans of the original swear by it, which leads me to believe that it must be a lot better than the American version.
The film postulates the existence of a video tape that, when watched, means death to the viewer. The moment the tape ends, anyone having enjoyed the surreal images represented on it receives a phone call informing them that they have one week to live. Exactly seven days later, they die, and nothing they do can stop the Grim Reaper. When a skeptical Seattle-based investigative reporter, Rachel (Naomi Watts), learns about the tape, she tracks it down and watches it. Shortly after being marked for death, she becomes a believer. So, with the help of her ex-boyfriend, Noah (Martin Henderson), who has also seen the tape, she begins an investigation to unravel the mystery before her time runs out. Along the way, a horrifying thing happens  Rachel's young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), sees the tape, sealing his fate.
If you were a mother who believed that watching a tape could result in a death sentence, would you leave it in a place where your son could view it? This is only one of numerous obvious problems with The Ring. The movie is so intent upon unsettling us that it loses sight of credibility issues like this one. Rachel's investigation is a follow-the-dots exercise in coincidence and contrivance, like a gothic version of bad Agatha Christie. The Ring has its share of memorable moments  the opening sequence with the girls watching TV and the horse-gone-wild on the ferry stick in my mind  but the connective tissue is Swiss cheese. And, when all is said and done, a whole lot of what has transpired doesn't make any sense.
Naomi Watts, making her follow-up to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, is suitably appealing as Rachel. (Is it just me, or does Watts resemble a blond version of her friend, Nicole Kidman?) Martin Henderson is fine as her ex-boyfriend and investigative partner. And Brian Cox has a chilling cameo. Unfortunately, the other key player, child actor David Dorfman, is a blank slate. He comes across as a knockoff of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense  and that's a performance I wasn't terribly excited by in the first place.
I don't recommend The Ring, but it's the kind of movie that could play well to small groups watching it on TV with all the lights out. At least there's no overload of gore  Verbinski has elected to go the suspense route. Unfortunately, he has such a weak script that his efforts amount to a not-so-triumphant victory of style over substance.",JP_Doc5_TheRing,JP,Horror,Negative,The Ring
175,JP_Doc6_TheRing,"Oh boy, this one is creepy. Creepy like a single, leaden knock on your front door when you're home all alone and it's 2:30 in the morning and it's October, and you're not expecting anyone and then the doorknob turns. Creepy like that.

The two times I've seen The Ring, audiences sat rock quiet. I couldn't help looking around the theater and staring at faces. They lacked the bored, slack-jawed multiplex gape. They giggled a little, yelped a little. But mostly there was a real chill in the air and nobody said a word.

That's because The Ring is a terrific audience picture that doesn't feel like one. Watching it with other people is like sitting at a dinner party where someone just accused the host of serving rancid meat. You want to crawl under your seat.

Before we get to the plot, it should first be said that this remake of a 1998 Japanese hit of the same name is also nuts, with a premise too insane to be believed. And yet, it's a kind of ingeniously lunatic idea that director Gore Verbinski makes work because the film is all silence and flickering visions.

The idea is that a VHS tape is circulating, and people watch it and a week later they flop over dead and end up looking like that time on South Park when Mr. Hanky was all dried out.

Yes, a murderous videotape. For one to buy this premise, one must accept the idea that a malicious supernatural force waited until home entertainment technology was sufficiently up to snuff to do its dirty work. On reflection, I would say this evil force is lucky; if it chose to infect a Beta tape, its revenge against humanity might have gone differently. Thankfully, The Ring doesn't explain why this malevolent ghost picked VHS. It doesn't feature a demon that forces unlucky souls to read their VCR manuals until their heads explode. It doesn't spend time hacking away at the usual movie teens.

It only starts with teens. Two girls sit in a bedroom and creep each other out. One says she like heard a story about this videotape that you like watch and then the moment it's over, like the phone rings. You answer and a voice whispers Seven days ... and a week later, you're like dead. I know: spooky. One reason the movie is effective is that it begins like an urban legend, with kids who get a visceral kick out of the story.

One of the girls says she watched a similar tape recently - indeed, she watched it with some friends seven days ago. A few minutes later, she's like history and stuff.

Enter Rachel, played by the excellent Naomi Watts of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. She's a Seattle newspaper reporter and aunt of the dead girl. She hears the story and tracks down the tape and, yup, decides to watch it.

Most horror movies wield an extra-yellow highlighter. This one simply drops the tape's eerie images in our lap. What Rachel sees is a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes: a shape backing away from a mirror, dead horses on a beach, a woman in Victorian clothing stepping off a cliff, a hand reaching out of a stone well.

It wouldn't be fair to go further. The film is set in Washington state and carries the same overcast spritz that Insomnia did earlier this year. Incidentally, along with that movie, it's the year's second decent Hollywood remake of a foreign film; that both are thrillers, rather than comedies or dramas, says something about how attuned directors can be to the primal nature of horror. It translates well. The ring of a phone or the faint static of a TV signal speaks volumes in The Ring.

The movie goes wrong when it tries to explain, when Rachel tries to connect the dots. The more the film explains, the less interesting it becomes. But you had to ask questions. Like, why does Rachel watch the tape if she heard it kills people? Because she's a reporter, and if she didn't the movie would be 15 minutes long. Why does she show the video to a second person?

Good question. But a better one is: How exactly does one stop an evil videotape? After falling apart toward the end, The Ring rights itself long enough to leave you with an ominous answer.

But then, nobody asked me how to stop it, and I have a great idea, one adapted from those convenience store owners who played classical music into their parking lots to discourage loitering teens.

Simply say: Hey kids, there's this lethal videotape and if you watch it you'll catch a mournful black and white Bunuel-esque treatise on the nature of death and dissolution and its relation to the female subconscious. My guess is the carnage would be limited to film critics.",JP_Doc6_TheRing,JP,Horror,Positive,The Ring
176,JP_Doc7_TheRing,"All that THE RING asks of us is to bide our time until the dynamite last 20 minutes or so, when all questions are answered, all patience is rewarded, and the preparations for the sequel can begin. For the other 95 minutes, we must watch an interesting premise made as bland and colorless as the rain-washed streets of Seattle where it is set.

It is there that we meet our exposition, or as it is incarnated in this instance, two teenagers swapping urban legends, theories about the surfeit of electromagnetic waves emanating from all our appliances, and makeup tips. I dont know about the make-up tips or the wave theory, but in this universe, the urban legend about a video that will kill you seven days later if you watch it happens to be true, as one of our plucky teen gals promptly demonstrates to her pal, who then promptly goes mad. 

From here our thriller becomes the story of Rachel and Noah (Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson), a generically good-looking ex-couple with little in common but emotional baggage and that spooky kid theyve created (David Dorfmann, sporting dark circles under his eyes for spooky emphasis). The dead teenager is Rachels niece and, since she is, conveniently, a reporter for the local major newspaper, she turns Nancy Drew to solve the mystery of the killer tape when odd things start happening, like photographs doing odd things to the faces of those whove seen the tape.
She finds the lodge in the middle of nowhwere where the niece and her pals watched the tape. She snags it and, of course, watches it. Think the worst student experimental film ever made, with all the pretentious symbolism at its Dadaist best, and thats pretty much what flickers on the television. As soon as its finished, the phone rings and a childs voice tells her that she will be dead in seven days. The same thing happens when she plays the tape for her ex-boyfriend. And, because if there were smart people in this movie, there would be no movie, the phone rings on cue again after her son finds the tape in the VCR and plays it.

Each of Rachels last seven days begins with a caption of the countdown. That helps because most of what happens doesnt make much sense as far as tracking down whats created this tape. We and the film seem to be spinning our wheels in A/V facilities, dusty libraries, and even dustier newspaper archives until the wildest of coincidences leads her to an island and Brian Cox and the sort of dirty little secret about madness and death that is the stuff of such tales of terror.

The performances are as muted as the gentle rain that falls continuously in the Pacific Northwest and the colors chosen by the art director so as not to jar us too much, range from beige to gray and then back again. Cox, because he is Cox, brings a prickly gravitas to the proceedings, as does Jane Alexander in an extended cameo as the islands crusty doctor.

As someone who in the course of doing her duty has had to sit through many, many bad films, Im here to tell you that the concept of a film so bad that it could kill you has occurred to me on more than one occasion, often with the vain hope that I would actually die so that I wouldnt have to endure any more of the bad cinema being splayed before me. So when I tell you that Im hip to the concept, you can believe it, hence my grudging affinity for THE RING. It has the courtesy to tie up everything with a nice little bow, plus the nifty special effects climax of that serious wallop at the end will not only creep you out, but will also make you look askance at your television for a few days afterwards.",JP_Doc7_TheRing,JP,Horror,Positive,The Ring
177,JP_Doc8_TheRing,"To paraphrase Forrest Gump, horror movies are like a box of chocolates: everyone has his own favorite kind. I'm much more a fan of chocolates than horror movies, but of this film genre, I think my favorite kind is The Ring. While some folks like them full of screams, jumps, and dripping knives, this movie captures the essence of horror in my idea of it. It is subtle, quiet, and deeply enigmatic, like a disturbing dream. To me, this is much more effective than special effects that beat you over the head. The acting is sufficient, not spectacular, but that is not really required if you have a director who can evoke the proper imagery. Gore Verbinski, the director behind such an eclectic list of films as the farcical 1997 children's comedy Mouse Hunt and last year's comedy-drama The Mexican, fits that description. Verbinski takes a mediocre concept (from the novel by Kji Suzuki, adapted by screenwriter Ehren Kruger, using some elements from Hiroshi Takahashi's screenplay for the 1998 Japanese version called Ringu), and a fair but relatively unknown cast (Naomi Watts, Mulholland Drive, and Martin Henderson, Windtalkers), and uses his talent for creepy visual artistry to make it an effective horror film.

The only unfortunate thing about this movie is its clear similarity, in plot, to the much inferior August release Fear Dot Com. In that film, it was a website that killed its viewers, and it did so within 48 hours. This time it's a video, and it gives them a full week. But both movies have a scary little girl, both have the victims seeing hallucinations and bleeding from the nose, and both have a man and a woman trying to figure it all out before they both become the next members of the six-foot-under club. The close conjunction of the two films' release dates eliminates any speculation that one is an imitation of the other, but it doesn't help to look like a copycat. Unfortunately for Verbinski and company, this is the result.
The story starts when a Seattle teen (Amber Tamblyn) and her three friends all die horrible deaths exactly at the same time, exactly 7 days after watching a weird videotape. The girl's aunt, Rachel Keller (Watts), a reporter for a local newspaper, investigates the case and watches the tape, a short video full of unexplained images like dead horses, a burning tree, and a comely woman (Shannon Cochran) who looks in a mirror and is later seen leaping off a cliff. Immediately after the film ends, Rachel receives a phone call with an ominous voice saying, ""You have seven days."" She calls her ex-lover, a telecommunications expert named Noah (Henderson), and reluctantly shows it to him. Then the phone rings again.
As the days count down from the moment of Rachel's viewing, she and Noah begin a frantic investigation of what the images could mean and who it is making the phone calls. During this period, they meet Richard Morgan (Brian Cox), the widower of the woman in the video, who harbors a dark secret. But the tension really gets high when Rachel's little boy (David Dorfman) watches the tape and gets his call.
The Ring (whose title, in the midst of Lord Of The Rings -mania, also looks unfortunately derivative) certainly contains many stock elements of the genre, like creepy images seen in mirrors, sleep-deprived zombie types that refuse to die, and red herrings, but somehow, director Verbinski is able to rise above the stereotypical material and craft a truly disturbing film, helped in no small part by the haunting, beautiful musical score by Hans Zimmer. It's not quite up to the quality of the star-studded Hannibal Lecter film Red Dragon, but it generally succeeds more than it fails.",JP_Doc8_TheRing,JP,Horror,Positive,The Ring
178,JP_Doc9_TheRing,"The Ring begins like your standard teen horror movie, as two high-school girls try to freak each other out by discussing a new urban legend about a mysterious video tape full of seemingly random, disconcerting imagery. Rumor has it that once you've watched the tape, you have seven days to live. One of the girls, however, has actually seen the tape. Guess who's going to die first?

From this opening segment, you know you're in for one long, creepy ride. The first ten minutes layer on the tension and dread in a painstaking way that is anathema to most teen/gore/slasher flicks. This pervasive feeling of dread, rather than cheap scares, is what carries the film when it occasionally slips into familiar contrivances.

When the first victim of the mysterious tape is found dead under bizarre circumstances (an understatement if there ever was one), the girl's aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) decides to investigate. Rachel is a Seattle Post reporter and single mother of Aidan (David Dorfman), an eight-year old boy who has begun to express strange visions through a series of eerie drawings.

Following the trail of clues like a good investigative reporter should, Rachel finds the tape in question. As she views it, the audience is treated to a bizarre string of seemingly random, disconcerting images. However, as she unearths more clues that lead her closer to the origins of the tape, the meaning of each image becomes a clearly defined piece in a jumbled puzzle.

While The Ring does lapse into some blandly familiar territory (the children always ""know"" first, animals go berserk when the evil is near, and a little girl talking slowly with a hollow stare is, once again, supposed to be the personification of all things scary), it always comes at the audience with something new to thrust the viewer back into unfamiliar and unsettling ground. And while the revelation of clues is at times a bit too expository (like Rachel mumbling the vital facts to herself as she reviews old newspaper clippings, just in case we're too slow to grasp the meaning from the clippings themselves), the realization of what the clues mean is profoundly eerie.

While not heavy on special effects, The Ring does contain some wonderfully disturbing imagery - beginning with a photograph that Rachel finds, showing the doomed niece and her three friends who have been ""marked"" after watching the videotape.

Director Gore Verbinski makes mostly smart choices here, building the tension for maximum payoff during the horror ""money shots"", and using the rainy Seattle weather and subdued, gloomy lighting to get the most out of that tense atmosphere. The performances are solid all around, including Brian Cox as a widower whose tragic past ties into the meaning of the tape, and Martin Henderson as ""Noah"", Rachel's friend, investigative partner, and potential love-interest. Even the kids give admirable portrayals, despite acting too mature and insightful for their age to be fully credible. Naomi Watts is definitely the star of the film, and while she doesn't quite display the range or intensity here that she did in Mulholland Drive, she once again proves herself as a very talented actress who we will (and should) be seeing a lot more of.

At its heart, The Ring is a campfire tale for the digital age. The telling of scary stories has mutated into grainy Xth-generation VHS copies which are passed from one victim to the next. Video killed the Radio Star, and now it's coming for You. I wonder what Marshall McLuhan would have thought about that.",JP_Doc9_TheRing,JP,Horror,Positive,The Ring
179,JP_Doc10_TheRing,"Much like a psychic, a cinema critic must look through a movie and see the other side. In the case of the new thriller The Ring -- remake of the 1998 Japanese hit, Ringu -- the formative forces swim into focus without effort. There's a Dreamworks boardroom, some executives exclaiming that Shrek can't be expected to pay all the bills, some heady talk of acquiring and retooling a foreign hit, plus some palpable annoyance that, stylistically, they don't control their own in-house M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) or David Fincher (Se7en) -- so they assign dependable director Gore Verbinski (The Mexican) to ape them. Heck, the cheapo Blair Witch Project made a mountain of money, and even a stink-bomb like Jeepers Creepers reached No. 1 at our nation's sometimes retarded box office -- so, they wonder, what's the secret of making post-goth eerieness go cha-ching?
Why -- the unfortunate bombast of The Haunting notwithstanding -- the secret is simply to find a functional formula and repeat it. Thus we receive this nonsensical yet satisfyingly sleek and suspenseful retelling of a grim tale about a disturbing videotape and the numskulls who doom themselves by watching it. (Insert Dorf on Golf joke here.) This Westernized, subtitle-free version comprises a pastiche of horror hooks, from pretty, petrified teens (lifted from any slasher epic or Don't Say a Word) to the standard creepy moppet (via The Shining and The Sixth Sense) to boob-tube bogeys ( la Videodrome and Poltergeist) to some good ol' family fun akin to that of V.C. Andrews (Flowers in the Attic). Basically, Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger embark willy-nilly on a scavenger hunt of scattershot spookouts, but if you completely bypass your brain and watch with only your eyes and nerves, you'll enjoy some good shrieks.
In an alternate Pacific Northwest, where horses commit suicide and yokel entrepreneurs drop rustic holiday cabins directly atop pits of unspeakable evil, we meet reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts, sensational in Mulholland Drive, suitably chilled out here). Since Rachel's airhead teen cousin Katie (Amber Tamblyn) and three friends were slaughtered by a roaming, belch-like sound effect exactly one week after viewing an excruciatingly artsy, Kenneth Anger-style video, Rachel smells a scoop and views the tape herself. Um, hello? Immediately the telephone rings, and she is informed by a voice that sounds remarkably like Poltergeist's delightful Zelda Rubenstein that she has but seven days left to live.
Rachel is skeptical at first, and feisty -- when told by her editor at The Seattle Post-Intelligencer that she's fired, she replies, ""No I'm not"" -- but once her estranged man Noah (Martin Henderson, sleepwalking) and strange son Aidan (David Dorfman, better suited to comedy) view the accursed tape, lethal creepiness changes her tune. The three desperately chase clues toward an enigmatic little girl (Daveigh Chase, lead voice in Lilo & Stitch and the English dub of Spirited Away) in hope of unraveling her wicked mystery and saving themselves.
Those who have partaken of Hideo Nakata's Ringu -- a scary but increasingly scarce import -- will note that this remake parallels his story (based on Koji Suzuki's novel) while adding various bells and whistles. Originally slated to be shot near Boston, the project skedaddled to Seattle following the horror of 9-11, and the region's inherent gloom serves it very well. In addition, the effects are yuckier, the jolts intensified, the score (by wunderkind Hans Zimmer) is punched to a fever pitch, and the killer ""ring"" video itself -- deviously distributed earlier this year at comic book conventions -- is now more grotesque than the original.
Speaking of comic book conventions, the style of The Ring (and superb cinematography by Bojan Bozelli) has less to do with X-Files plundering (or the similarly themed Feardotcom) than with that awesome comic label Vertigo, best known for its highly stylized tales of madness and mayhem. Since the logic of the source material (and its worthy sequel, Ringu 2; franchise, anyone?) is iffy at best, Verbinski wisely concentrates on darkly sensuous imagery, which, apparently, was storyboarded very much in a pulpy comic vein.
Fortunately, The Ring also redeems its loopy plot with some killer concepts. In a gruff cameo, Brian Cox (Manhunter) rants, ""What is it with you reporters? You take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it, spread it like a sickness!"" Said sickness grows more virulent with our heroine's conclusive discovery about her fate and the evil tape, in a denouement that hardly offers hope for humanity. Her dark revelation comes as a relief, for at last Dreamworks has given us the stuff of nightmare.

180,VRT_Doc1_Lamb,"It is not by chance that it is precisely in these moments of health crisis in which the destructive action of a simple coronavirus has shaken the certainty of the human species about its alleged superiority over so many other animal species, when they are produced in auteur cinema some notable films about humanoid hybrids (metal and human flesh in Titane , by Julia Ducournau; sheep species and mankind in Cordero , the first feature film by Icelandic Valdimar Jóhannsson), which start from postmodern allegorical intuitions or simple folkloric fables to transform them into authentic horror stories. In the case of CorderoThe idea is to show the commitment of a couple of farmers who, after losing their little daughter, decide to compensate for this loss by adopting a baby sheep that they dress, treat and see grow as a human being, making it the object of parental care as solicitous as inordinate.

Based on a script by the filmmaker Jóhannsson and his collaborator Sjón (Sigurjón Birgir Sigurosson), the latter writer and lyricist of the singer Björk, the film describes the routine existence of María (Noomi Rapace) and her husband Ingvar (Hilmir Snaer Guónason), in a very isolated farm in the north of Iceland. Among the many unknowns that the story raises, or that it leaves as empty spaces, is the interaction of the characters with other human beings in the region. Their world seems to be restricted to a meticulous herding of rams and sheep, an occupation that seems to have canceled all substantial communication in the couple itself. There is little dialogue in the film and the chilly dominant atmosphere emphasizes the quiet way the marriage has of coping with the grief over the early disappearance of their only daughter. To this is added some strange phenomenon such as the mysterious irruption of a supernatural presence inside the cattle-raising area. After having assisted their ewes in multiple labor tasks, Ingvar and María discover that one of them has given birth, without help, to a lamb that has very new characteristics that immediately seduce them. Mary thus deprives the mother sheep of her young, assumes the right to adopt it as her own, and very soon the home, formerly gloomy, is illuminated with the providential arrival of a girl / lamb who will receive the name of Ada, even from the deceased daughter. to a lamb that has very new characteristics that immediately seduce them. Mary thus deprives the mother sheep of her young, assumes the right to adopt it as her own, and very soon the home, formerly gloomy, is illuminated with the providential arrival of a girl / lamb who will receive the name of Ada, even from the deceased daughter. to a lamb that has very new characteristics that immediately seduce them. Mary thus deprives the mother sheep of her young, assumes the right to adopt it as her own, and very soon the home, formerly gloomy, is illuminated with the providential arrival of a girl / lamb who will receive the name of Ada, even from the deceased daughter.

The way in which the marriage lives its new domestic normal is disturbing. It seems like a family cell willing to turn its back on any notion of natural order. An unexpected visitor, Ingvar's brother and a former rocker in decline, becomes the only human witness to the unusual filial replacement in this highly original profane family. It is he who, in his own way, warns the couple of the danger they incur by altering the laws of nature in this way. In a particularly emotional scene, the stripped mother ewe emits in front of the window of the house her long bleat of unease over the kid that has been kidnapped, hoping that the latter will respond. Her futile confrontation with the opportunistic surrogate mother is one of the film's most dramatic moments, and despite its improbable and fantastic nature, it will undoubtedly manage to disturb more than one viewer due to the immense burden of injustice that human abuse entails. And it is that in a similar way to moral positions that denounce racial discrimination or gender violence, the film implements, in a novel and brutal way, a critique of the arrogance of speciesism, understood as the belief that the human species is, for own right, far superior to any other animal species, a prejudice that frees the individual from all responsibility or guilt for the unfair treatment inflicted on other animals (classic example, bullfighting). María and Ingvar alleviate their human pain at the cost of long animal suffering, and the consequences of this ethical arbitrariness –socially tolerated in many other cases– will be reflected in a stealthy revenge of the animal world in the form of a fantastic hallucination. A tale with a dark moral, very in tune with the kind of absurd and disconcerting narratives that are likely to prosper in our times of tenacious uncertainty.",VRT_Doc1_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Positive,Lamb
181,VRT_Doc2_Lamb,"Fear is relative. When it comes to horror as a genre, what scares some might not scare all. And between the marketing strategy and October release date for A24’s latest, ""Lamb,"" it would be natural to assume that this is a horror film meant to take advantage of the spooky season. What a disappointment, then, that ""Lamb"" turns out to be a bait and switch. The film is focused on familial loss, transformative grief and the second chances found in children, and all of that can be moving in a particular way. But scares? Few of those are found here. 
To be fair to ""Lamb"" director and co-writer Valdimar Jóhannsson, he describes his latest film as ""a classical drama with genre and surrealist elements."" If A24 hadn’t built an advertising campaign around a flock of sheep as malevolent, vengeful beings, perhaps expectations going into ""Lamb"" wouldn’t be so high. Alas.
There are glimmers in ""Lamb"" of the movie that could have been: one that leaned into folk horror, one that was more explicit in depicting how our fears seem to come to life in the night, or one that presented surrealist elements and asked us not to accept them, but challenge them. Instead, great stretches of ""Lamb"" pass by in which life is lived, but not much else happens. There’s little narrative tension past brief inconveniences that the characters deal with quickly. And although Noomi Rapace (""The Girl with Dragon Tattoo,"" ""Passion""), Hilmir Snær Guðnason (""Polite People"") and Björn Hlynur Haraldsson ground the film emotionally, they seem to exist outside of the film’s attempted dread. Their performances don’t quite match the environment in which the film is enveloping them, and the result is a strangely limp dissonance. 
Perhaps that methodology is meant to lull us into complacency, and into accepting the strangeness on screen, until the film decides that what we’ve come to see as normal can no longer be treated as such. But that pivot happens so quickly, and with so little payoff, that ""Lamb"" ends with frustration rather than fulfillment.
Set in rural Iceland, ""Lamb"" follows married couple María (Rapace) and Ingvar (Guðnason), who run a sheep farm. Months, and maybe even years, pass with them not seeing anyone else in this land where the sun never sets. They treat each other with affectionate concern but also a polite kind of distance. They have their own routines, spend time in separate areas of their home and barely talk during dinner. A tragedy in their past is implied, and a room full of children’s items remains unused. 
Until one day during the lambing season, when María and Ingvar experience something strange. In a scene that captures the subtle facial expressions that Guðnason and Rapace use to build their characters, husband and wife decide to bring a particular lamb home. What happens after that choice drives the remainder of ""Lamb"": the joy María and Ingvar find in their new roles as parents to a creature they name Ada, the unease that Ingvar’s brother Pétur (Haraldsson) brings into their domestic bliss with his unexpected arrival, and the trespass upon their homestead sensed by the family’s dog, but no one else. 
The film is incredibly sparse in dialogue, and so entire scenes are constructed around the trio of actors’ minute reactions to each other and to the mysterious, inexplicable Ada. Some of this is provocative (María’s recurring nightmare of sheep watching her; Pétur initially deadpan reaction to Ada), some of it is legitimately poignant (the tenderness with which Ingvar treats Ada), and most of it is shot with precise beauty by cinematographer Eli Arenson. 
But ""Lamb"" struggles to make clear how much sincerity or acceptance we should apply to what is happening on screen, and the result is both narrative and emotional murkiness. Is this objectively real, or subjectively real to the characters? Should our opinions on those two possibilities differ? ""Lamb"" can’t decide. 
A major difficulty is the film’s failure, until its final moments, to visualize Ada with the same depth and nuance as its human characters. By that point, it’s too little, too late. And while Rapace, in particular, provides some unsettling moments throughout ""Lamb,"" the film’s monotony hampers whatever haunting impact Jóhannsson might have intended. For a horror film befitting Halloween, keep grazing past ""Lamb."" ",VRT_Doc2_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Negative,Lamb
182,VRT_Doc3_Lamb,"Lamb is about a strange thing that happens to two people who resolutely refuse to acknowledge it as anything other than normal. The tension between the absurd and the mundane is the heart of this doodle of a film, which is the directorial debut of Valdimar Jóhannsson, who wrote the script with the novelist and poet Sjón. The first time the sturdy fabric of life on the Icelandic sheep farm where the film takes place rips open, husband and wife Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) and Maria (Noomi Rapace, who’s Swedish, but who lived in Iceland as a child) stare at each other in shocked silence. And then, with a tilt of an eyebrow, they incorporate this addition into their lives, still not exchanging a word. It’s not until Ingvar’s ne’er-do-well sibling Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) turns up in the second act, having been ingloriously ejected from his life in the city in what seems to be a regular occurrence, that someone dares mention out loud that something unusual is going on. He’s quickly shushed, Ingvar telling him firmly that “There’s nothing for us to talk about.”
If it feels like I’m playing coy about what the inciting anomaly is, that’s only because the movie also plays coy with it at first. We’re given a series of teasing glances and half-obscured shots before finally getting a real look at a sight which, by that point, we’ve already formed a version of in our heads. What’s come into Ingvar and Maria’s lives is a compound creature with a human body and the head of a sheep, one born unceremoniously during an otherwise normal lambing season. The mongrel’s mother, separated from her baby, bleats piteously outside the couple’s house, until Maria, plagued by troubling dreams, drags the animal out into a field and shoots it. She’s determined to raise Ada, as she’s named the changeling, as her own, and Ingvar seems more than willing to go along with the arrangement. “What the fuck is this?,” Pétur asks his brother tersely after his first encounter with Ada, and Ingvar answers, simply, “Happiness.”
Lamb isn’t a horror movie. It’s more like a fairy tale, with all the darkness that most fairy tales have before they’re tidied up for contemporary consumption. The story fits into a tradition of childless couples finding otherworldly infants that stretches from Kaguya-hime, the princess discovered in the forest by a bamboo cutter and his wife in Japanese folklore, to Superman, the extraterrestrial found in a Kansas cornfield by the Kents in what, I guess, is folklore of the American kind. And like all of these stories, the understanding that something will eventually come calling for these miraculous offspring is always looming over the proceeding — Ada came from somewhere, after all, beyond the womb of a slaughtered sheep. Still, for a long stretch, Lamb is about life on the farm. Jóhannsson has a way with wordlessness that goes beyond the film’s concept and undeniably Scandinavian deadpan sensibility to inform the way he transmits essential information about his characters.
That fact that the couple’s experienced heartbreak in trying to conceive is conveyed, for instance, by the way that Ingvar pulls a crib out of storage in the barn and sets it up for Ada. The lulls between an idle conversation over breakfast suggests that Ingvar would be content with a future of just the two of them on the farm, while Maria yearns for more. The way that Pétur touches Maria’s face when they’re alone makes it clear, before he says anything, that they’ve slept together before, and that he’d like it to happen again, while she’d prefer to move on. Lamb is deft enough with these details that it’s frustrating that there’s so little to it, that it feels like it could have been a great short instead of an underwhelming feature, and that it leans more and more heavily on its unsettling central creation. And Ada’s certainly memorable, especially once she’s girl-sized and dressed in practical sweaters. She understands speech, but at the same time the tiny sounds and the expressions she makes are entirely animal, with a ruminant’s blankness that isn’t cute or easy to anthropomorphize.
That’s the point in Lamb — that even in this outpost of domestication and agriculture and mankind’s dominance over the land and the elements, nature is not so easily claimed. But it’s not a point that the movie seems to feel all that passionately about. By the time the final act rolls around, Lamb approaches the idea that there’s a price that must be paid with a shrugging diffidence rather than impending doom. It’s such an underwhelming conclusion to a film with such a compelling start. You might start to wonder if the taciturn nature of the project is less a stylistic choice and more an indication that it just doesn’t have that much to say.",VRT_Doc3_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Negative,Lamb
183,VRT_Doc4_Lamb,"In “Lamb,” Valdimar Jóhannsson’s directorial debut, the eyes have it.
It’s the eyes, both animal and human, that convey more than any speech, starting with a herd of chubby, wild-eyed ponies that scatter in a snowstorm upon recognition of an encroaching presence.
That menacing force remains largely unseen around the edges of this folk tale, though it’s alluded to in the gaze of an anxious sheepdog, or a watchful house cat skeptically standing sentry. Ominous mountains look down upon the pastoral arena where this fantastical yet meditative rural drama plays out; it’s a modern folk tale about the strange realities of life and death that such a closeness to nature affords.
As Maria, Noomi Rapace’s eyes are constantly searching, both the dramatic landscape and the face of her husband, Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason). They’re sheep farmers living in a remote Icelandic valley, with an ease to their taciturn quotidian rhythms and symbiosis with the sheep. Ingvar fries up a chop before he and Maria ease a slick newborn lamb into the world, their small circle of life constantly churning under the simple labors and pleasures of daily life. There is, of course, an incoming spoke in the wheel.
The film’s Big Reveal has already appeared in the trailer, and so it seems within bounds to describe its precise nature, though indubitably it would be much more incredible and shocking to watch this film without any idea of what’s coming. If you haven’t seen the trailer, stop reading now.
A lamb is born, though that’s not what’s remarkable. Unlike the other lambs, Maria and Ingvar bring this particular one inside, bottle-feed it, swath it in warm blankets, keep it in a crib that Ingvar pulls out from storage in their barn. They care for this little lamb as if it’s their own baby, much to the protestation of the ewe that birthed her, bleating plaintively outside their bedroom window. A maternal standoff ensues; it doesn’t end well for the ewe.
Finally, we get a peek at what’s under the the blanket. The lamb Ingvar and Maria have named Ada has a white furry lamb’s head with big expressive eyes, but the body of a human child. They raise and clothe and love Ada as their own, and she fills a profound void in their lives. When Ingvar’s deadbeat, washed-up rock star brother Petúr (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) turns up on their doorstep, he’s astonished, bewildered and frankly disgusted. But he too becomes tender toward the little girl.
Fans of genre cinema, including Rapace’s roles as an action heroine, or the brand of arthouse horror for which the film’s distributor, A24, is known, may be expecting something a bit more intense from “Lamb,” which is mostly a quiet family drama. It’s a different register for Rapace, who remains controlled, with a few explosions of emotion. But she is present and instinctual, imbuing Maria with a steely but soft power: decisive, persuasive and feminine.
A sense of foreboding hangs over the proceedings, the score grinding with an industrial intonation, humming over the misty mountains and their snowy secrets. But fundamentally, “Lamb” is a folk tale, bookended with elements of horror, typical of darker fables; legends abound in the film, whether on a TV or in “The Story of Dimmalimm,” about a princess who falls in love with a swan who turns into a prince.
The film is broken into three chapters, and by the time it comes to its end there’s the startling realization that there is potentially much more to come, something even more bloody and terrifying — but those are tales better left for another day.",VRT_Doc4_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Positive,Lamb
184,VRT_Doc5_Lamb,"he horror-proximate fantasy “Lamb,” which opens Friday in theatres, is the first feature by the Icelandic director Valdimar Jóhannsson (who co-wrote the script with the musician and novelist Sjón), and it plays more like a calling card, a display of professionalism, than an experience. There are only about twenty minutes of its one-and-three-quarter-hour running time that sustain any interest, thanks to a late-breaking twist of industrial-strength cleverness. The narrative trickery that sets up the story—and the sense of a setup is palpable throughout—results in a grossly oversimplified tale that reeks of cynicism. “Lamb” preens and strains to be admired even as it reduces its characters to pieces on a game board and its actors to puppets.

The subject of “Lamb” is a fantasy that’s planted with meticulous yet narrow attention to a realistic context. María (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) are a young couple on a farm in a remote part of Iceland. They grow crops (most prominently, potatoes) and they raise a few dozen sheep, which live in a barn a short walk across sloping fields from their comfortable and casual little farmhouse. Their workdays involve driving a tractor, leading the sheep through fields, schlepping hay for the sheep to eat, preparing meals, helping sheep give birth, tagging and logging the new arrivals. But their regular routine is disturbed by the barking of their dog near the barn; the couple go in to see what’s up with the sheep, and, looking surprised, note that one of the sheep has given birth without help. Taking the newborn in her arms, María brings it back to the farmhouse, where, wrapped in a blanket, it lives in a metal washtub. They feed it milk with a baby bottle and raise it in the house, dragging a crib from a storage area to a space next to their own bed, where the swaddled lamb will live.

Despite glimpses of the grand, mountainous Icelandic locale and of activities in the house and on the farm, “Lamb” offers virtually no characterization, no inner life, no substance. There’s nothing wrong with a mystery filmed from the outside, in which only observation of the characters elicits clues. But “Lamb” constructs its characters solely as clue generators; their identity is limited to their function. The gap between what the characters know (or, for that matter, who they are) and what they’re shown doing is blatant and frustrating; it makes the movie resemble pages of redacted testimony on which there are more stripes of black ink than legible text. It is, for instance, only a third of the way through the film that the lamb in question is revealed to be actually a hybrid of lamb and human—her head is that of a lamb, and her right arm is a lamb’s furry foreleg, but the rest of her body is humanoid. This fact, known instantly by the couple and weighing on them like some sort of grave matter, is kept a secret from viewers.
María and Ingvar name the ovine girl Ada (pronounced “ahda”), dress her in sweaters and pants, and raise her as their daughter. A few years pass. Ada is now a calm toddler, who walks upright; she doesn’t speak, but she understands what María and Ingvar say. Then the family gets a visitor—Ingvar’s ne’er-do-well brother Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson), a former rock musician, who is rudely dumped from the trunk of a car onto their property by a trio of people whom María and Ingvar assume are his creditors. María and Ingvar are surprised that Pétur has returned, which is to say that he used to live or visit there; it’s never made clear, but this is in any case the first time he’s been there in years, and thus the first time that he meets Ada. His skepticism about the couple’s decision to raise her takes on an especially bitter and menacing edge, for reasons that are only very belatedly and very thinly suggested to the viewer (but are instantly obvious to all three adults). María and Ingvar fear that Pétur is going to do something to harm Ada or otherwise get rid of her, and this air of fear and menace—combined with Pétur’s efforts to spark an affair with María—drives the drama.

There is nothing anywhere in the film to suggest what María and Ingvar are thinking. For the first ten minutes, they don’t say a word. When they’re shown reading or writing, the substance is neither seen nor heard. When they finally do speak to each other, it’s to exchange banalities. They say nothing of substance about their daily lives or immediate concerns—for instance, not a word to each other about Ada’s unusual form, about any practicalities that it entails, about the significance to them of her presence. Something has been out of whack in the household (hint: the crib in the storage room) but, much as it’s in the forefront of the couple’s minds, even in their activities, the information isn’t dropped in the film until very late, and then only as a virtual onscreen Post-it. (In a prime example of the director’s cagey, shticky way with information, even the protagonists’ names are dropped late into the story.)

Physical labor is dispatched in similarly emblematic ways. Do María and Ingvar sell the sheep? Butcher the sheep? It’s never shown, or even suggested. Their isolation—do they have any friends, any other relatives, any visitors who might also register surprise at Ada’s unusual form? None that are seen, and the story appears to span about five years. Pétur’s skepticism regarding the couple’s raising of Ada is similarly dispatched in a hollow sentence or two. The silences that follow the scant, merely informative dialogue are stupefying silences in which characters are conspicuously turned empty, as if by directorial fiat. Even the movie’s images are stultifyingly retentive, offering information in serenely decorative form and even cutting the best elements—its rare closeups of Ada and of sheep—to merely indicative snippets.

In part, the frustration that “Lamb” elicits is a function of the craft that obviously went into its making. The problem is that all of the evident thought was channelled narrowly into making sure that the story sticks its landing. Far from considering the implications and possibilities opened by its story, the film’s careful organization stifles them. Without any loose ends—and without any conceptual or stylistic audacity behind its sparseness—“Lamb” appears cut off not only from its characters’ inner lives but from the inner life of its creators. Films of humanoid hybrids are having a moment: Julia Ducournau’s “Titane” is also currently in theatres, and the director follows the implications of its fantasy premise to wild extremes; what it lacks in the overt voicing of its characters’ subjectivity it furiously and splendidly makes up for with the director’s own teeming inner worlds and visionary imaginings. “Lamb” reduces fantasy to an excuse and imagination to a product. To my surprise, it won the Prize of Originality in the “Un Certain Regard” section of this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

In its native Icelandic, the film Lamb goes under the title of “The Animal”. This 2021 indigenous  folk horror/drama is the feature-length directorial debut of Valdimar Jóhannsson, who co-wrote the screenplay with poet and novelist Sjón. 
The prologue opens on the harsh, snow-covered, rural Icelandic landscape at Christmas, something sinister spooks a group of horses, and the sheep on this isolated farm bustle and barge their way through their enclosure. Later when Spring breaks, it’s lambing season, and we’re introduced to the day-to-day drudgery of the farm work – Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason) hangs up his winter coat as he gets to work, followed by his loyal sheepdog while his partner, Maria (Noomi Rapace), who mans the machinery, their land dwarfed between huge mountains. This is a couple with little to say, their interactions are stilted, distant, their paths rarely cross on their vast stretch of acreage.
Birthing one of the lambs, the couple exchange a pointed look – this lamb is something special. They take the newborn inside and lovingly feed her with a bottle. As they care for the little creature, Maria and Ingvar’s bond deepens. They raise her like she was their own, placing a cot next to their bed – their little Ada. The couple become frantic when the lamb goes missing, and is rescued by her birth mother, the same sheep that calls outside their window every day. This elicits a deep well of uncharacteristic  jealousy in Maria.  With the unexpected arrival of Ingvar’s brother, Piotr (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) their insular domestic bliss is impeded upon and things start to take a sinister turn..
Utilising a deft hand in curating this film’s aesthetic, Jóhannsson relies on minimal dialogue to convey the distance between the couple as well as their unnatural relationship with their adopted offspring. It’s quite beautiful to behold. Prior to shooting this film, his credits span the Camera and Electrical Department of some major international  productions – a skillset he brings to framing and capturing the changing mood of the wild terrain. However, with regards to the CG creatures and sheep, the uncanny valley is just too deep, which is off-putting and in those initial scenes before we’ve invested in the premise.
While the lack of dialogue works well, the absence of plot does not. The pacing, which can be mood building in folk horror, is just excruciatingly slow and punctuated by the bare minimum of shocking moments, surreal reveals or violence against animals to keep us engaged (and vaguely tense). It’s important to note, that this is certainly not an easy watch for vegans or sensitive animal lovers of any kind. The themes of grief and loneliness are only halfway explored and characters as written are somewhat underdeveloped, however Jóhannsson did an outstanding job with his micro-cast. Swedish actress Rapace (Lisbeth Salander from the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) brings such authenticity as a grieving mother, that she plasters over any of the aforementioned cracks in the narrative, and completely sells what, in less skilled hands, would be a rather silly film. Her on-screen chemistry with Ada and Snær Guðnason is subtle and deeply truthful, making this film a very challenging watch indeed. ",VRT_Doc6_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Positive,Lamb
186,VRT_Doc7_Lamb,"Perhaps the all-around strangest movie to be getting a wide release this year, Lamb is a movie best entered blindly. Though, if you’re at all logged on and in the sphere of Film Twitter release hype, it may have been difficult to avoid the ludicrous selling point that the film is built on when the trailer was released. Nevertheless, if you’ve managed to stay cold for this one, all you need to know is this: Sheepfarmers María (Rapace) and Ingvar (Guðnason) live a seemingly peaceful, if emotionally distant, life in an idyllic Icelandic valley where they tend to the land and their animals. When one of their sheep gives birth to a notably peculiar baby lamb, María and Ingvar see it as an ample opportunity to mend their relationship and come together as a family.
Set up as yet another in a long line of A24-released self-serious, portentous genre films, Lamb’s ultimate saving grace is in its low-key absurdism. The film starts as you’d expect: long, wordless, thoughtful shots of our main couple working their farm, helping their sheep birth their lambs (effectively setting the disconcerting mood by shooting the process, up-close and in real life), eating quiet dinners together – all presented in a cold blue-gray color palette and detached aura. It seems to suggest a greater unspoken emotional turmoil between the characters that’s bound to boil over; it’s also exactly what you would expect from one of these ponderous, This Is About Something modern arthouse horrors.
But then there’s a shift. Once the titular lamb in question becomes involved, the film becomes more of a surprisingly radical subversion of the tropes of this extremely familiar structure. The image of this lamb is so profoundly preposterous, and thus in its own way so completely gripping, that it’s impossible not to let out astonished laughter at it. Whether director Valdimar Jóhannsson (in a bold feature debut) means for it to be as funny as it is can be called into question, but it works regardless. As the characters continue to exist and operate within the confines of the dreary, esoteric movie that this appears to be, the titular lamb works to move this into a space of almost a satirical skewering of the genre. It’s best summed up by Ingvar's reprobate brother, Pétur (Haraldsson), who arrives at the farm unexpectedly and is thrust into the situation: “What the fuck is this?”
Taken away from that lens of comparison, Lamb is still ridiculous but by way of being something of a modern fable, a slice of atmospheric folk horror for today’s audiences. At its core, there’s a genuinely affecting story about parenthood and the burden of loss. María and Ingvar both carry a great sadness within them, and the fact that they see a potential to heal within their unlikely adoptee lends its presence and their love for it a certain sweetness, and the story an apt mournful quality. This balance of touching sentiment and ridiculous imagery doesn’t quite carry through to the ending, which leaves things rather abrupt and cold. Still, if you like your affected character dramas with a healthy dose of weird insanity, you may just find yourself head over hooves.",VRT_Doc7_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Positive,Lamb
187,VRT_Doc8_Lamb,"Shortly after Norm Macdonald’s death, a 2009 clip of the comedian telling his “moth joke” on The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien went viral. A rambling shaggy-dog story about a moth pouring forth its troubles to a podiatrist, the joke accumulates a kind of giddy anxiety in the listener as Macdonald stretches this thin premise well past the point of decorum for a late-night talk show, loading on more and more existentialist misery before, finally, getting to the hilariously anticlimactic punchline. Why is this moth telling all this to a podiatrist rather than a psychiatrist? Because the light was on.
Lamb plays a bit like a feature-length version of Macdonald’s gag, stretching its absurd premise as far as it can possibly go before blowing the whole thing up in a final moment of winking mischief. Valdimar Jóhannsson’s film centers on an adorable half-human, half-lamb hybrid born on a remote Icelandic farm whose proprietors, Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason), decide to raise the creature as if it were their own child. The baby, which they’ve dubbed Ada—the same name, not incidentally, as their previously deceased daughter—is doted on by her adoptive parents, who treat her as a kind of divine salvation from trauma. “Ada is a gift,” Maria at one point says, “a new beginning.”
Lamb gains much of its oddball energy from the preposterous cuteness of its central image. The titular creature, a mostly seamless combination of child actors, puppetry, real animals, and CGI, is at once adorable, amusing, and oddly unsettling, the physical embodiment of humans’ tendency to anthropomorphize animals. Much of the film consists of relatively mundane depictions of rural domesticity, which are given just the slightest frisson of surrealism by the presence of a chimeric critter dressed in the cutesy wardrobe of a human toddler. In certain passages, Lamb plays as a satire on childless millennial couples’ propensity to dote on their “fur babies” as if they were their actual offspring.
Unfortunately, Lamb’s novel premise only goes so far, and after a certain point, the film’s quietly deadpan minutiae simply becomes tedious. This is largely due to the sameyness of Jóhannsson’s visual style. The film opens with a portentous tracking shot of horses ensconced in a deep fog, which recalls the work of Béla Tarr (who’s credited on the film as an executive producer). But after this, Jóhannsson settles into a mode of picturesque understatement reminiscent of fellow Icelander Grímur Hákonarson’s pastoral comedy Rams. Like Hákonarson, Jóhannsson emphasizes the almost unearthly beauty of rural Iceland, but there’s a superficiality to this approach, as if the filmmaker were trying to use his picture-postcard imagery to paper over the film’s fundamental lack of ideas, drama, tension, or mystery.
Lamb assembles a grab bag of themes—grief, domestic strife, sibling rivalry, parental overreach, and more—but the only one that receives more than a passing nod is the idea that Maria and Ingvar’s adoption of Ada isn’t really so innocent. This is signaled early on in scenes of the couple going about the chores of the farm, treating their herd of sheep not like treasured children but as the livestock that they are. Only Ada, a lamb that just so happens to have some human limbs, is treated as something special. Jóhannsson subtly points up Maria and Ingvar’s hypocrisy with a number of subtle visual gags—such as the couple enjoying a Christmas lamb dinner and dressing Ada in wool sweaters woven from the coats of her sheep brethren—as well as some not-so-subtle narrative beats involving the ewe that birthed Ada.
The film pads out its runtime with a visit from Ingvar’s brother, Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson), a recovering addict who’s at first confounded by Maria and Ingvar’s inter-species adoptee before happily embracing the role of doting uncle. Pétur’s rapid change of heart subverts our expectations but also leaves the character with little to do. A subplot involving Pétur’s infatuation with Maria goes nowhere fast and highlights the fact that Jóhannsson, having contrived a singularly captivating central image, don’t really have much to say about it.",VRT_Doc8_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Negative,Lamb
188,VRT_Doc9_Lamb,"The first thing to notice about the unsettling Icelandic-language drama “Lamb” is that the animals are far more expressive than the people. It’s the horses, a dog, a cat and the oh-so-many sheep who actually seem to have emotions, not their taciturn human overseers, husband Ingvar and wife Maria, who grimly go about the business of running their isolated farm with little sense of family or frivolity.
For the first 40 minutes or so, as Ingvar (Hilmir Snaer Gudnason) and Maria (Noomi Rapace) live their hard but unremarkable lives set against the bleak beauty of the North Atlantic landscape, Valdimar Jóhannsson’s film seems more like some sort of National Geographic documentary about the rigors of surviving in rural Iceland. But, slowly, Jóhannsson — who wrote the script with acclaimed Icelandic novelist/musician/Björk collaborator Sjón — slowly reveals the layers beneath the frigid emotional topsoil.
Ingvar and Maria are still mourning the loss of a child, no doubt contributing to the silence between them. Then Ingvar’s brother, Pétur (Björn Hlynur Haraldson) — fresh from some shady deal that he’s running from — shows up unannounced looking for a place to crash for awhile. There’s also some history between Maria and Pétur, though Ingvar seems to be still in the dark.
The game changer is another unexpected guest, one born in the barn amid the clearly distressed sheep, who sense there’s something weird going on. But the hole in Ingvar and Maria’s life caused by the sadness over the lost baby is replaced by the joy of finding something else that needs to be cared for.
What follows is both magical and horrifying, in both the story itself and the movie’s visuals. Jóhannsson and Sjón tap into a sense of pre-Christian Icelandic folklore while special effects supervisor Freyr Ásgeirsson and cinematographer Eli Arenson bring it all to life, coming up with a film that’s a prime example of Scandinavian folk-horror. In other hands, “Lamb” could have just been silly, but here, it’s genuinely discomfiting, though not particularly scary.
How viewers respond to “Lamb,” which won an Un Certain Regard award at Cannes, depends on how much they buy the film’s central conceit. Gudnason and Rapace (who’s Swedish but spent her early years in Iceland and speaks the language) both possess a brooding intensity that helps make the whole thing believable.
Again, it’s the animals (and their wranglers) though who deserve the most recognition. After all, the film’s canine, Panda, also took home a prize at Cannes: the grand jury award in the Palm Dog Grand Prix competition. But it is really too bad that there isn’t a similar award for sheep. 
The Icelandic-language drama, a Cannes Un Certain Regard award winner, is a prime example of Scandinavian folk-horror. ‘Lamb’ may be the strangest film to hit Houston multiplexes in October 8 2021. The language used is Icelandic with English Subtitles, and the movie is rated R for some bloody images, sexuality/nudity. The total run time for the movie ""Lamb"" is 106 minutes. I will give this strange Scandinavian folk-horror 4 out of 5 stars (must watch).",VRT_Doc9_Lamb,VRT,Horror,Positive,Lamb
189,VRT_Doc10_Lamb,"There no other obvious way to start this review than by saying: Lamb is an odd one. Beautiful; sure. Evocative; yes. However, it only tantalises at the mythology or events which underpin the narrative, and as such the world it offers is a partial one. How forgiving you are of this will depend on how you weight aesthetics and mood against old fashioned coherence.

Lamb is loosely based on a story from Icelandic folklore – though you would only know that if you’d read the film’s ‘liner notes’ – and it features a married couple, Maria (Noomi Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnaso). They are sheep farmers somewhere in remote Iceland, a thankless enough task, but one underpinned by a certain lack of communication between them; they simply get on with the jobs at hand. Other critiques have noted their relationship as characterised by deep misery, though this reviewer didn’t read it as anything that severe, more a kind of unsaid acceptance of their lot. Things are about to change, however. At winter, something ‘other than normal’ seems to be threatening their flock (and one of the things which this film does amazingly is to show animals apparently getting into their acting roles). Come lambing season, one of their ewes delivers a lamb with some sort of as-yet unseen difference. Rather than placing the lamb back with its mother, Maria takes it – wrapping it with a shawl as if it was a human baby. This all happens very early on in the film, by the way, so hopefully isn’t a spoiler; more anon.
At this point, her decision to do so is a mystery; likewise, the acceptance of this lamb, christened ‘Ada’ by Maria, simply takes place with a largely accepting response from Ingvar. Maria’s maternal jealousy swiftly shapes events for the worse, but it’s the fact that Ada seems to be some kind of human-sheep hybrid which begs the most questions; neither ‘parent’ questions it. The return of Ingvar’s brother Petur (Björn Hlynur Haraldsson) affords the script one or two opportunities to question this bizarre course of events, but other than generating a handful of suggestions of some kind of sexual undertone between Maria and Petur, simply slots another family member into this set-up. We simply observe what Ingvar refers to as their “happiness” in raising little Ada.

The film is sweet and considerate of this happiness, and this is one of its key strengths. Indeed, Lamb did not turn out as I expected, which was either as a symbolic exploration of the pain of loss, or a riff on the perils of nurturing unnatural offspring – something like Grace (2009). Lamb is neither of those, and Ada – even as a CGI-generated entity – is a pleasant little critter; director Valdimar Jóhannsson has done a great job capturing the nuances and commonplace gestures of small children, even if said small child isn’t your average child (can we also assume that putting Ada in a wool sweater was an example of the film’s few moments of dark humour?) But in focusing on this meandering family bliss, the film omits things, choosing to say almost nothing about bereavement or the impact of it. There are gaps, which prioritise atmosphere, but at some expense to how easy it is to engage with these events. Given that the film opts for the trendy device of adding on-screen title chapters, there must have been some awareness of providing structure and linearity, but it doesn’t really arrive. (That being said, do not watch the film trailer, which condenses down all the measurable plot points and therefore ruins them in ways which no review has done).

Lamb has many merits – its performances, its terrific setting, its quite unique strangeness – but it can’t quite offset its omissions with these. Taken as a whole, though, it’s a gentle and considerate piece of work which will charm many viewers with its careful ambience.

190,MRG_Doc1_Poltergeist,"In 1982, Poltergeist director Tobe Hooper (and writer/producer/secret-director Steven Spielberg) spooked the apple juice out of a nation of kids with a canny combination of jury-rigged practical effects. With two little words—“They’re here”—a pipsqueak Heather O’Rourke brought the haunted-house subgenre back from the great beyond, after William Castle’s dime-store hokey fun laid it to rest in the early 1960s. The suburban home that sets the stage for Gil Kenan’s superfluous new remake suffers from a spectral affliction of a different nature: the poltergeist of the original Poltergeist. By claiming the 1982 film’s name as its own, Kenan’s picture must necessarily justify its own existence as a separate entity, and not a demonically possessed regurgitation of Hooper and Spielberg’s frights. For the most part, however, the soul of Kenan’s film has been perverted, and it’d take more than a world-renowned paranormal investigator to salvage it. When Maddie (Kennedi Clements), the updated model of O’Rourke’s character, turns and intones those magic words, she lacks the original’s sing-song cadence. It’s a tuneless cover within a tuneless cover. Like a gaping inter-dimensional closet portal, the Poltergeist remake sucks in overqualified actors and spits them out, not in a purgatory swarming with poorly rendered CGI skeletons, but in a needless recitation of a bona fide horror classic. The saddest casualties are Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt as the terrorized clan’s pater and mater familias, easing their brood through the trials of relocation to a new house in a new town. Their organic, easy chemistry props up the remake’s underdeveloped lone thematic interest. The heart of 1982’s Poltergeist was the parental bond, the mother and father’s dauntless drive to recover and protect their child. Kenan’s film also centers on the family unit, though his approach involves gently probing its fissures. Money troubles have befallen the Bowen bunch, and a son (Kyle Catlett) scared of his own shadow, as well as Maddie’s inexplicable behaviors, only compound existing tensions. No horror-movie family is complete without a surly, resentful teenager, so Saxon Sharbino completes the core fivesome as Kendra. She’s the most vocal opponent of the Bowens’ move to their ghostly new digs, and the main offender when Mom and Pop half-jokingly refer to “those jerks” after a long day of unpacking. The Bowen abode has foundational problems that make flying termites look like a day at the beach; an infestation of malevolent spirits swarm around the graveyard on which the home was built, a minor property detail the realtor omitted. Supernatural domestic disturbances ratchet up from slightly shifted furniture to full-blown mayhem (two words: demon squirrel), and before long, little Maddie has been kidnapped by the specters. Kenan sweeps all the family’s problems aside as the parents spring into action to retrieve their daughter, which doubles as an overly basic statement on the duties of parenthood, and a convenient cheat code to minimize untied plot threads. (If the family’s so strapped for cash, why is Rockwell buying fancy new gifts for everybody? Just ask Anton Chekhov.) The Bowens call in the professionals, a pair of divorced ghost hunters played by Jane Adams and a delectably arch Jared Harris, doing their darnedest with the wafer-thin characters they’ve been dealt. Their rapport is the most welcome departure from the original film, bringing a lightness that still can’t buoy the bland rehashing of old tricks. The other attempts to transpose Hooper’s film to the 21st century—using the eerie feedback from an iPhone as a detector for poltergeist activity, sending a camera-equipped drone to explore the astral plane—fail to add anything meaningful. Almost all the scares that connect have been imported from the original. That is to say, the terror inherent to clown dolls is eternally enduring. It bears mentioning that Kenan is a perfectly competent director, just weighed down by the project’s inherent needlessness. His observant, unobtrusive camerawork establishes the spatial relationships of the house’s floor plan comfortably and naturally, which becomes critical once all hell breaks loose. His scares are about as fearsome as an empty Poltergeist DVD case—which is, in many ways, what this is—but it isn’t hard to imagine Kenan flourishing in a different genre. If 2015’s Poltergeist was simply a mediocre horror film, it would most likely provide young couples with decent background noise to muffle the sounds of their fierce make-out sessions. But because 20th Century Fox insisted on drawing on the original brand’s popularity, Kenan’s film ends up as a markedly inferior iteration of something that already exists. Though the memory of Hooper’s picture haunts every frame of nü-Poltergeist, Kenan’s will fade unseen into the great beyond first.",MRG_Doc1_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
191,MRG_Doc2_Poltergeist,"Everything that goes wrong in Poltergeist stems from an act of desecration; the building of a cookie-cutter housing development on top of an old cemetery. Some might find the sheer act of attempting a remake of Poltergeist similarly disrespectful; the 1982 original is something of a masterpiece of suburban terror. But if viewers can look past the sheer audacity of attempting another Poltergeist, they’ll find a solid modernization, the cinematic equivalent of a decent cover version of a great rock song. It’s totally superfluous, and not nearly as satisfying as the original, but well-performed and effective in its own way. It’s nice (or, in this case, deeply unsettling) to revisit an old classic in a new arrangement. The basic story beats will feel very familiar to anyone who knows the first Poltergeist by Tobe Hooper (or, depending on whether or not you believe the Hollywood legends, by writer-producer-and-possibly-uncredited-actual-director Steven Spielberg). A family of five, the Bowens, move into a new home in an unremarkable housing development. Almost immediately, they begin to notice strange occurrences. At first, they’re benign; lights flickering, balls rolling around on their own. But the weirdness escalates, and in the chaos, the family’s youngest daughter (Kennedi Clements) gets dragged into some sort of spiritual dimension. To retrieve her, the Bowens consults a group of academics from a local college (led by Jane Adams) who specialize in the paranormal. When they need backup, they bring in another expert; a flamboyant TV ghost hunter played by Jared Harris. To use another music metaphor, 2015’s Poltergeist plays all the greatest hits fans expect from this property. There’s a spooky, static-y television, and a little girl announcing “They’re heeeeeere.” A haunted tree and a clown doll or two pop up to terrorize the heroes. But director Gil Kenan and screenwriter David Lindsay-Adaire do make some small but crucial tweaks. Harris replaces a medium character previously played by Zelda Rubenstein, and where the first Poltergeist generally focused more on the women of the family, this one focuses more on the men. That includes a beefed up role for the family’s pre-teen son, Griffin (Kyle Catlett); many early scenes are shot from his perspective and his maturation from nervous wreck to unlikely hero is the most dramatic and satisfying character arc in the film. It also shifts this Poltergeist away from Hooper and Spielberg’s and brings it closer to Monster House, Kenan’s own animated horror movie about a young boy who summons the courage to defeat a malevolent spirit. The father character, Eric (Sam Rockwell), is different as well. Formerly a sellout realtor, he’s now unemployed and working through some anxieties of his own; namely that he won’t be able to live up to his promise to his wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) to provide for the family while she stays home and pursues her love of writing. Early scenes of the Bowens’ home lives crackle with carefully observed details about domestic unease. One particular bannister in the house is constantly charged with static electricity, shocking anyone who touches it. Obviously the poltergeist is to blame, but it’s also a nice symbol for the tension that’s pulsing through this family. Everyone’s on edge. Rockwell is one of those actors who seems incapable of delivering a bad performance. Even in middling B-movies (like, say, a cash-in horror remake), he brings his A-game. Not surprisingly, he’s terrific as Eric. Like a less eccentric and self-parodic Christopher Walken, he always finds funny, unusual phrasings in his dialogue, and brings a quirky yet naturalistic vibe to everything he does. It’s a funny, sad, authentic performance, and he has lovely chemistry with DeWitt in their frustratingly brief scenes together. With respect to Craig T. Nelson, this is one area where this Poltergeist might outpace the old one. Just as the Bowens’ familial conflicts really begin to churn they get shanghaied by meddling ghosts, and from there the movie mostly settles into a more conventional, less character-driven groove. With most of the major set pieces taken directly from the old film, there aren’t many surprises, but Kenan sort of uses that to his advantage; teasing out the horror as long as he can, building lots of suspense while the viewer waits for the shocks they know are inevitably coming. Some scenes are ruthlessly effective; the paranormal expert who tries to drill a hole in the closet from hell and finds himself on the receiving end of his own power tool is a real squirmer (particularly in the film’s visceral 3D). Kenan’s Poltergeist is unnecessary, but not boring. If given the option to watch either version of this story, you’d naturally choose the original 10 times out of 10. But if you randomly stumble across this movie on cable or streaming someday, you’ll be relatively entertained (and you’ll probably get a big kick out of Sam Rockwell). There’s no doubt Kenan understands how to wring every last jolt out of an audience. It’s too bad he’s got to waste that gift remaking a movie instead of delivering something original. That’s Hollywood these days; instead of making the next Poltergeist, they just make another Poltergeist.",MRG_Doc2_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
192,MRG_Doc3_Poltergeist,"“Poltergeist” is heaving with the scariest things you can possibly imagine: The mad clown doll that comes alive. The undead seeking revenge. The bitchy teen girl. You can sense why the ghouls don’t kidnap the high schooler. Who would want to spend eternity listening to her gripe about her broken smartphone? Building on the sacred bones of 1982’s “Poltergeist,” this serviceable remake sticks fairly closely and smartly to the same plot, with the same scary objects and even the line, “They’re here.” A young couple (Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt) with a bratty teen girl (Saxon Sharbino), boy (Kyle Catlett) and adorable 6-year-old girl (Kennedi Clements) loses the latter when the TV swallows her. Getting her back means hooking a rope to the wall, stepping into Satan’s closet and trying to find the girl among the writhing dead whose spirits infest the house because it was built on a cemetery. It all comes at a 21st-century clip: This is that rare movie that’s actually too short. You’re barely halfway through your box of Jujubes before there are grasping corpses burbling out of the muck, strangly clowns and a tree busting through the window. The remake improves on the original in a couple of respects: The effects are much better, of course — there’s a fantastically creepy interval set among rows of restless corpses underground — and the script is lightly witty without resorting to cheap self-mockery of the “we know we’re just characters in a movie” variety that ruins so many horror movies. Much of the wit, I suspect, is down to the incomparable Rockwell, who turns the usual false-alarm early scare into a laugh line: He hurls himself against the walls a few times, contorts his face in horror and announces, “We have a squirrel.” There’s also a fun idea in having the ghost hunter (Jared Harris) be the host of a cheesy reality show and the parapsychologist (Jane Adams) be his ex-wife. “I have special powers!” he boasts. “You’re not that special,” she replies. The move hints that it’s going to broaden the original movie’s reach from satirizing TV addiction to terror of anything with an off switch: They’re everywhere! One thing that goes bump in the house is Mom’s shin, after she walks into a box because she’s looking at her iPad. But the movie, directed by Gil Kenan (“Monster House”), feels like the studio cut it down to the bare minimum, figuring that the horror-movie audience has no time for the kind of niceties that would have rounded things out. So the subtext gets tossed, very little time is spent on establishing character bonds, and the back story about the house being built on a cemetery is reduced from whole scenes to a couple of lines of dialogue. Maybe that’s a good thing, but it’s hard to explain why the film didn’t reprise the thrilling moment when JoBeth Williams turned a rope into an artificial umbilical cord and went into the darkness to save her baby. Still, there’s plenty to rattle your cage here, and just as the original was one of the scariest PG movies ever, the reboot has about as much gruesomeness as you can possibly stuff into a PG-13.

193,MRG_Doc4_Poltergeist,"The closing credits for Gil Kenan’s remake of the 1982 horror classic “Poltergeist” feature the band Spoon covering the Cramps’ 1980 punk classic “TV Set.” Spoon is a tasteful, studious yet largely anodyne indie rock outfit that has become an NPR staple; the Cramps were a scuzzy, unhinged psychobilly band whose most famous gig took place in an actual mental hospital. It’s hard to think of a more fitting postscript for this professionally executed yet bloodless film, itself an act of homage that hews reverently to its source material while missing the essential spirit and vitality that once powered it. Generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary, this tribute-band take on one of the genre’s greatest hits should score decent opening weekend numbers before finding its way into the light. In addition to being one of the most unsettling PG-rated films ever made, the original “Poltergeist” — directed by Tobe Hooper, with not-insignificant input from producer-scripter Steven Spielberg — touched a particularly sensitive nerve thanks to its grasp on the early Reagan era zeitgeist. Steeped in the consumer comforts of the upwardly mobile middle class, the film ingeniously turned its most innocuous status symbols — the brand-name appliances, the cookie-cutter planned communities built on seemingly virgin territory, the comforting hum of static coming from TV sets in every room — into nexuses of terror. Now three decades later, Kenan and scripter David Lindsay-Abaire have made efforts to contemporize the story’s framework, but these new touches never dig anywhere near as deep. Rather than a successful real estate agent, for example, paterfamilias Eric (Sam Rockwell) has recently been laid off from his job; his wife, Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt), is no longer simply a homemaker, but rather an unsuccessful writer who effectively functions as a homemaker. Faced with financial pressures, the two have moved their three children to an idyllic yet permanently overcast suburban community. (Why they would choose the precise moment when they’re both unemployed to buy a new four-bedroom house is a question for another day.) These kids include bratty teenager Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), cherubic 6-year-old Madison (Kennedi Clements), and middle child Griffin (Kyle Catlett), who is afflicted with a level of anxiety befitting an early Woody Allen character, and is the first to notice strange, ghostly phenomena in their new abode. As one would expect, all three youngsters are chained to their phones, tablets and remote-controlled drones, which are employed to mildly novel use throughout. Yet the film is most thoroughly modern not in its embrace of technology, but in its rush to accommodate compressed attention spans. Substantially shorter than its predecessor, the new “Poltergeist” has hardly even established its characters’ names before the kids are already being attacked by demonic clown dolls and reanimated corpses, and Madison, magnetically drawn to a malfunctioning TV set, is quickly abducted by the house’s malevolent spirits. From here, Kenan mimics the story beats of the original almost exactly, as the family turns first to a paranormal academic (Jane Adams), and later to a flamboyant medium (Jared Harris) to try to rescue their little one. Less a steadily escalating thriller than a guided tour through a county-fair-style haunted house, “Poltergeist” offers some quality jump scares, and Kenan has a knack for staging solid individual setpieces. But he proves weirdly incapable of modulation or mood setting here, stringing together loud noises and “right behind you!” jolts without much regard for pacing or buildup. His directorial debut, “Monster House,” actually offered a far more clever take on traditional haunting tropes, as well as an obvious model for the character of Griffin, whose role here has been greatly expanded from his counterpart in the original. The cast largely acquit themselves well, even when deprived of much opportunity to really develop their characters. As he did in last year’s “Laggies,” Rockwell plays the slightly boozy, goofy father figure with great charm and likability, and Catlett makes for a believably wise, harried tyke of the Haley Joel Osment mold. DeWitt is unfortunately rather ill served by the film’s most significant divergence from the original, which robs the character of her great moment of maternal heroism. Harris, taking over for Zelda Rubinstein, has fun channeling another vintage Spielberg production, “Jaws,” as a rough, scarred, Quint-essential spook-hunter. Visually speaking, Javier Aguirresarobe’s photography is solid — and while generally unnecessary, the 3D work sometimes adds an extra layer of claustrophobia to the creeping interior shots — yet the film’s attempts to illustrate the spirit world bring to mind Nine Inch Nails videos more readily than any otherworldly chthonian purgatory. Composer Marc Streitenfeld turns in a largely effective score, though it can’t help but pale in comparison to Jerry Goldsmith’s Oscar-nominated original. Indeed, even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates “Poltergeist’s” themes, it’s hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them, and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings. Some franchises die, but they don’t know they’re gone. And then some franchises just get lost on their way to the reboot.",MRG_Doc4_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
194,MRG_Doc5_Poltergeist,"It’s infrequent and particularly satisfying when the remake of an especially memorable film equals or exceeds the experience of the original. In 1982, Poltergeist saw the brilliant pairing of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre’s low-budget horror director Tobe Hooper with far more mainstream screenwriter and producer Steven Spielberg for an effects-laden event movie that earned its place as a contemporary benchmark among supernatural thrillers. Leaving behind the youth-skewing perspectives of Monster House and City of Ember, director Gil Kenan not only delivers on the promise of Hooper’s Poltergeist, but significantly raises the stakes for similar PG-13 fare. With strong brand identity and two generations of moviegoers to cultivate, MGM and Fox’s Memorial Day weekend release should help boost the summer box office to a promising start with a solid opening frame, although prospects for franchise-building (the original was followed by two sequels) look somewhat mixed. In setting the scene, Kenan and the filmmakers take their cue from the first film in the trilogy, as Eric Bowen (Sam Rockwell) and his wife, Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt), crippled by the financial impacts of the Great Recession, look to downsize so that they can continue adequately providing for their three kids. They find what they’re looking for in a distressed but affordable home for sale that’s located in a nondescript development full of vacant properties on the outskirts of an Illinois town where Amy attended university. Youngest daughter Maddy (Kennedi Clements) is excited to move in following the initial tour after conversing with some new invisible friends who speak to her from a mysterious bedroom closet. Anxiety-prone middle child Griffin (Kyle Catlett) isn’t thrilled to be settling into an attic bedroom, however, where an ominous willow tree looms over the house through a rooftop skylight. Teenage Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) displays visible disaffection with her new situation, preferring to remain in touch with her old life and friends via phone, text and video chat. On the first night in their new home, while everyone else is asleep, Griffin discovers Maddy talking to the big-screen living room TV as it flashes and emits strange noises. “They’re here,” she says, referring to her friends, “the lost people.” Now Griffin has some solid reasons to feel worried, especially after noticing objects moving around the house of their own accord and discovering a box full of scary clown dolls stashed in a storage space. His parents just attribute these trepidations to his chronic anxiety, and it isn’t until the next night when they’re out to dinner at a neighbor’s house that they discover some disturbing information regarding their new home that sends them rushing back to check on the kids. By the time they arrive, Griffin and Kendra have suffered supernatural attacks and Maddy has vanished completely. At their wit’s end, Amy and Eric decide to seek guidance from Dr. Claire Powell (Jane Adams) from the Department of Paranormal Research at Amy’s former university. Powell agrees to assist, bringing in her staff to wire the Bowen’s home with video cameras and monitoring equipment in their search for the missing child. They soon determine that Maddy is able to speak to them through the TV set, but can’t provide any clues to her whereabouts. Powell concludes that the house is under the influence of a malevolent poltergeist that has abducted Maddy, holding her in a shadowy, in-between realm that they will have to access in order to rescue her before she disappears completely. As the film reaches its midpoint, all of the essential elements of the original are in place and in part this satisfying continuity is attributable to a screen story again written by Spielberg. In scripting the remake, David Lindsay-Abaire hews closely to the earlier template, replicating some key scenes with more contemporary flair while ratcheting up the pacing by cutting 20 minutes off the running time. Updating the spiritual medium character with hardbitten reality TV host Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris), an Indiana Jones-style ghostbuster, provides a recognizable pop-culture reference, blowing away the musty cobwebs of stereotypically aloof psychics. Although Rockwell appears capable of holding the Bowens together in the face of financial and personal peril, it’s a rather under-written part that lacks the frequent character tics he’s exploited more memorably in smaller-scale films. DeWitt is the predictably supportive emotional core of the family, eventually driven to extremes by her daughter’s predicament. In a substantial role for a young actor, Catlett favorably impresses with his comprehensive grasp of Griffin’s neuroses and his determination to face them head-on in several pivotal scenes. The integration of notably naturalistic visual effects with the digital filmmaking is frequently almost seamless, until the setting shifts into an entirely supernatural realm during the final attempt to retrieve Maddy. Kenan’s overall improvements to the movie’s visual style aren’t only attributable to advances in technology and a 3D update, however. While Hooper favored shock value and jump scares, Kenan and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe construct far more fluid sequences as the camera glides and hovers over its subjects, reserving the most impactful shots for a concluding sequence that’s particularly thrilling.",MRG_Doc5_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
195,MRG_Doc6_Poltergeist,"The TVs are bigger than they were in 1982, but the scares in the new “Poltergeist” don’t match the ones offered by director Tobe Hooper and producer Steven Spielberg the first time around. This new spooky-house chiller never escapes the shadow of its predecessor, but it also pales next to the scores of subsequent movies — “The Conjuring,” “Insidious,” and “Paranormal Activity,” to name just a few — that have already stripped the original “Poltergeist” for parts. Even if the results are forgettable, producer Sam Raimi has, if nothing else, assembled an impressive team. Director Gil Kenan made his directorial debut with the effective (and genre-adjacent) animated film “Monster House,” playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (“Rabbit Hole”) handles script duty, and casting directors Scot Boland and Victoria Burrows have put together a capable ensemble, from established players like Rosemarie DeWitt and Sam Rockwell as the put-upon homeowners to young Kyle Catlett as their son. (Catlett not only registers genuine fear and anxiety throughout, but he also looks like he could really be DeWitt’s child.) Unfortunately, the wrong moves outnumber the right ones, and the attempts that this “Poltergeist” makes to stand on its own merely underscore what the original film did so brilliantly. Whereas the first movie, for example, shocked audiences by setting a haunted-house movie in an otherwise ordinary and normal-seeming suburb, this one lets us know right away that something’s amiss, from the giant power lines nearby to the bones barely buried in the yard to the box of clown dolls in the attic. Yes. A box of clown dolls. As though a discovery like that wouldn’t make a new tenant immediately run screaming. Anyway, it’s just the second night that Eric (Rockwell) and Amy Bowen (DeWitt) spend in their new house before youngest daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements) gets snatched up by the restless souls in the closet, and it’s only with the help of paranormal expert Claire (Jane Adams) and basic-cable ghostbuster Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) that the Bowens can get their little girl back. The film’s most effective scene is also the one that shows us the least: Claire’s skeptical assistant Boyd (Nicholas Braun, “Date and Switch”) has a creepy encounter involving an electric drill and an unseen entity on the other side of the wall. This is one of the few moments that Kenan and Lindsay-Abaire let us use our imagination; taking us into the parallel dimension of the ghostly departed isn’t nearly as terrifying as the suggestion of same that the original movie offered, and since we’re operating in the realm of PG-13 horror here, the gore is mild and the jolts are almost all of the jump-scare variety. Given how little they have to work with, DeWitt and Rockwell — and even Adams and Harris, to a lesser extent — do what they can to inject recognizability into the sketchiest of stock characters, and Catlett, Clements, and Saxon Sharbino (“Touch”) as the three Bowen children create a significant amount of empathy; their reactions to the horrors taking place around them are often more effectively portrayed than the horrors themselves. “Poltergeist” ultimately plays like the most perfunctory of remakes, one born of rights ownership and title marketability rather than a burning desire on anyone’s part to do something interesting or provocative with a classic. The 1982 original remains unassailable, all the more so when stood side by side with its pipsqueak descendant.",MRG_Doc6_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
196,MRG_Doc7_Poltergeist,"Rarely has a remake felt more contractually obligated than the 2015 version of “Poltergeist.” There are a few decent performances, a nice riff on the technology fears that drove the original movie, and a centerpiece of horror that works, but never once do you get the feeling that the people behind this remake are here because of artistic passion or creative drive. They’re here because, well, somebody had to be here, so why not them? With remakes of “Nightmare on Elm Street,” “Friday the 13th,” “Evil Dead,” and more already on the books, “Poltergeist” is even arguably a bit late to the party. And they didn’t bring a gift. The Bowen family has fallen on hard times. Eric (Sam Rockwell) has lost his job at John Deere, forcing them to move to a new home, one which his teenage daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) openly mocks. Mother Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) has raised a beautiful family, but may have to go back to a day job to make ends meet. Son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) is going through that fearful time of childhood when we hear noises in our closets and wonder what’s under the bed. Finally, Madison (Kennedi Clements) is a unique little girl, the kind who talks to her imaginary friends a bit too often. Before the Bowens have even unpacked, weird things are afoot in their new abode. Griffin hears sounds in his attic bedroom, and finds a box full of creepy clown toys. He also really doesn’t like the look of the old tree nearly scratching his skylight. One night, while Eric and Amy are out to dinner, all Hell quite literally breaks loose. In a pretty effective centerpiece, all three children are attacked separately. Hands popping out of the floor, trees crashing through windows, and those damn clowns—it’s a solid sequence that ends with Madison being taken to the other side. As she fights for survival between worlds, the Bowens have to call in paranormal experts (including Jared Harris and Jane Adams) to save their little girl. Tobe Hooper’s “Poltergeist” had two thematic foundations that have been essentially transferred intact to Gil Kenan’s version. It was no mere coincidence that little Carol Ann was sucked into her TV as fears that the idiot box would forever destroy the next generation were pretty common in the early ‘80s. In the update, technology is everywhere, and even integrated into the narrative in scenes like the one where Kendra hears something strange through the static on her smartphone and the later use of drone technology. The fear of technology isn’t quite developed adequately here (nothing is), but I liked how David Lindsay-Abaire captured the modern world in which we are surrounded by electrical toys—the ominous shots of the power lines behind their house are not accidental. Even more importantly, “Poltergeist” in both forms has a solid answer for the common question that plagues haunted house movies: Why don’t they just leave? By the time the Bowens figure out what’s going on, one of them is missing, and they’re forced to band together to save her. In many ways, especially in the original, it’s about a broken family uniting in common cause to save one of their own. That element is strong here thanks in no small part to believable husband-wife chemistry between Rockwell and DeWitt and solid kid performances, especially Catlett. The problem is that neither of these elements feel fresh or new. Nothing about “Poltergeist” feels fresh or new. And while the mere joy of seeing actors like Rockwell and DeWitt do their thing works for a little while, it can’t sustain as the horror narrative intensifies and a few things get decidedly goofy to maintain the PG-13 rating. By the last act, I really didn’t care what happened to the Bowens or those brought in to save them. The stakes don’t feel nearly as high here and the thematic undercurrents of the first act have disappeared as the actors and filmmakers go through their motions. Harris is having fun as a reality TV star ghost hunter but he can’t fix the screenwriting flaws of a project that inevitably feels like it's just racing to the end, and not in a way that produces any sort of tension. Maybe we’re a more cynical audience and the films that have copied the original “Poltergeist” over the years have lessened the impact of the original blueprint so slavishly followed here. If that’s the case, Kenan and his team needed to find another reason to update it. Or any reason at all really. One Final Note: Rarely has 3D been less essential or felt like more of a cash grab. See it in 2D if you choose to see it at all.",MRG_Doc7_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
197,MRG_Doc8_Poltergeist,"Within Hollywood’s ongoing remake cycle, the 1982 hit “Poltergeist” is a choice both obvious and challenging. A touchstone for much in contemporary horror, with its emphasis on a family in peril, then cutting-edge effects work and some sly satire, the original “Poltergeist” was an efficient, intense haunted house story for and about its times. Directed by Gil Kenan — nominated for an Oscar for his 2006 animated film “Monster House” — the remake is a disconcertingly uneven outing, not quite connecting in the manner of the original while also never standing firmly on its own two feet. The new “Poltergeist” is a pleasant enough diversion, better as a low-simmer suspense story than a full-blown effects extravaganza. In the new film, Amy and Eric Bowen (Rosemarie DeWitt, Sam Rockwell) are moving into a more downscale house with their three children after Eric has been out of work for some time. As a series of unexplainable disturbances escalates, Amy and Eric learn their subdivision was built on land that was once a cemetery just before their youngest daughter, Madison (Kennedi Clements), becomes trapped in a supernatural spirit realm. The Bowens appeal first to a parapsychologist (Jane Adams), who in turn brings in a medium/reality TV personality (Jared Harris). Together, they all try to get Madison back. The ‘80s-era original, directed by Tobe Hooper, produced and co-written by Steven Spielberg, was about what might be lurking and repressed underneath the façade of a perfect suburban life, with Craig T. Nelson’s dad character even seen reading a book on Ronald Reagan. The talk of layoffs and foreclosures in the new film shows that dream already broken from the start, so there is little other left for the otherworldly to reveal. David Lindsay-Abaire, best known for his family trauma drama “Rabbit Hole,” wrote the screenplay for the new film in which the kids have tablets and smartphones and young Madison becomes stuck inside a flat-screen. But nods to modernize the story never meaningfully connect it to the here and now, apart from the use of a flying toy drone as a tool to first visualize how things look on the other side of an interdimensional portal. The storytelling is choppy in a way that feels like some things were left in the cutting room. Amy and Eric attend an awkward dinner party that isn’t even talked about on the drive home. While the parents in the original film smoked a little pot when behind their bedroom doors, the Bowens have a drink or two, with a lingering, unexplored implication that Eric drinks a little too much. DeWitt, Rockwell, Harris and Adams are among the most dependable performers around today, and much of what works in the new film is thanks to them. As the action in the film ramps up, it’s hard not to want the story to pause so the four of them can just hang out a bit more, as they all create warm, vibrant characters that seem trapped within the mechanics of the plot. And yes, the new film includes the original’s famous tagline of a young girl saying, “They’re here.” But it undercuts its effect by unnecessarily preceding it with her warning, “They’re coming.”",MRG_Doc8_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Negative,Poltergeist
198,MRG_Doc9_Poltergeist,"When little Carol Ann Freeling ominously intoned ‘They’re Here!’ in 1982′s Poltergeist, she wasn’t just announcing the fact that ghosts had discovered suburbia, but that the new overseers of blockbuster filmmaking were finally appropriating the supernatural horror genre. When Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper moved the classic tropes of the ghost story to the land of mirror-image housing, Reagan-era values and burgeoning baby-boom anxieties they poured the haunted foundation for what would become the current blueprint of the sub-genre. Now, we’ve finally arrived at the inevitable moment when the original must pay the piper for its iconic trailblazing and receive its own remake. Fortunately for Poltergeist, you could do a lot worse in this department than Gil Kenan’s amiably pleasing little spook show. In the few years prior to the original Poltergeist, the haunted house motif was still enjoying relatively classical interpretations with the likes of The Shining, Ghost Story and Peter Medak’s The Changeling, whose most turbulent supernatural image was George Scott bellowing at the unseen phantom that dared roll a toy ball down his staircase. None of those movies would have even conceived of the Spielbergian sound and fury that closes Poltergeist, with the offending house itself literally pulling up its roots and imploding into some other misbegotten dimension. Special effects and visceral evocation overtook a venue that had largely depended on atmosphere and suggestion, and not all the films that followed Poltergeist were as adept as marrying their human elements to the spectacle. When that original movie ended, it left us with the disconcerting revelation that the suburbs weren’t just haunted, they might actually be spiritually unhealthy for us with their soulless sameness and downsized ambitions. The filmmakers were addressing the body-snatching makeover of our personal lives, but did they for-see the identikit 3D horror pictures of today? Would they have shuddered at what was wrought? Either way, like it or not, here’s a new Poltergeist, calling itself a reboot but feeling for all the world like a mostly literal remake of the 1982 picture that shuffles a few of the themes and concepts but ends up looking like the same house, mildly remodeled. The new family that moves into the paranormal epicenter of the neighborhood is The Bowens, whose arrival here signals their movement down the financial ladder, trading up a higher class of living due to the recession. Unlike The Freelings, whose shiny new home in Cuesta Verde was one of the signposts of patriarch Steve’s career success, The Bowens aren’t experiencing the affluent haze of the American dream. Eric (Sam Rockwell) has been laid off for some time and troubles finding a new job have left him listless and frustrated, his wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) is a would-be novelist struggling to hit that sweet note that would help lift the family out of peril, and their kids, teenage Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), pre- adolescent Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and 6-year-old Madison (Kennedi Clements) are still reeling from the upheaval of their old lives. The signs that the house is sinister start early here, with tree branches automatically receding into the earth, a box of extraordinarily creepy dolls appearing in the attic, and a dinner party conversation that casually drops the words ‘tribal burial ground’. In an intriguing development, the daily struggles of the Bowens are initially more compelling than the echoes of supernatural malice. Finally, there’s the pivotal sequence that launches the film forward; Eric and Amy are away at dinner, and the children fall prey to a trio of unearthly invasions, involving creepy creatures in the basement, the hijiinks of a particularly malevolent tree, and a spectral abduction that manages to be harrowing in the same way its predecessor was. Maddie is now trapped in a spiritual dimension beyond the Bowens grasp, held hostage by whatever forces are using their home as personal puppet theater. Gil Kenan, whose Monster House was a delightful ode to that transitional time in 80’s cinema that melded the wonder of Spielberg with the eccentricity of Tim Burton, handles these scenes remarkably well. His visual aesthetic and scene construction brings a certain value to the perspective of the kids, who get to have their own internal reactions and opportunities for heroism that were denied them in the first film, which, to be fair, was mostly the story of their parents. Screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire builds a plausible and endearing dynamic, drawing off the first’s most definable trait, its portrait of familial solidarity in the face of the unknown and unimaginable. The unknown and unimaginable get pretty well imagined here, thanks to the advancement in special effects since 1982, and even though the first go-round was no slouch in the supernatural action department, Kenan’s picture takes it to another level. Hooper and Spielberg had some large scale set pieces to deploy and limitations in what they could and couldn’t show, so the first film used brilliant editing and composition to give the illusion of consolidated paranormal phenomenon that felt like an escalation event. Here, the camera glides smoothly around the fantastical compositions and towards the climax, gives us a full-fledged visualization of the world beyond ‘the light’. This particular manifestation is imaginatively creepy, drawing from medieval visions of limbo and purgatory to furnish an afterworld far more satisfying than the spasming phantasmal hulla-balloo of Poltergeist II’s version of the same place. The critters aren’t quite as effective this time through, and that includes the evil little clown that attacks Griffin. That first doll was a mostly normal, vaguely threatening little ragamuffin, while the new iteration looks like Annabelle’s circus-bound son; the clown has been so overdesigned that he becomes less instead of more scary. He’s clearly a horror-movie creature that wouldn’t exist outside a film, anddoesn’t have the same effect a more benignly real creature would have when it begins to do things it shouldn’t, like throttling you in your sleep. The hauntings, while specatcularly realized, never have the same troublesome impact when they occur, partly because we are never quite as connected to the characters. Maybe, too, it’s because we’ve already seem them before. Effects aside, Kenan’s film would barely get off the ground without his actors, who don’t have the same richness of depth to work with that relative newcomers JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson and Heather O’Rourke had. Rockwell gives another strong and human performance and its starting to feel unlikely that he ever gives otherwise; Eric is a more fragile creature than Nelson’s straight-forward Steve, but the actor finds some potent compartments of both humor and fear. His breakdown once he realizes his daughter may be beyond his reach is overwhelming and poignant. DeWitt does nice work echoing Williams’ harrassed stay-at-home mom who will cross whatever dimension necessary to rescue her children. I liked best Catlett—who is left with real guilt about his inability to save his sister—and Clements as Madison, who gives a believably sensitive turn that references but doesn’t coast on O’Rourke’s performance. All of them come together and convince us they are a real family operating in an surreal situation. Perhaps the trickiest part of the new Poltergeist is getting right the attempted rescue mission to the other side, because in the older film, that sequence was the unmistakable emotional centrepiece of the whole thing. Pivotal to its effect was Zelda Rubinstein’s Tangina, the psychic who’s called into help the Freelings. Diminutive yet commanding, Rubinstein came off as such an original and ennervating force that her 15-or-so minutes of screentime dominate the entire film. When she speaks the lines “To, her it simply is another child. To us, it is the Beast”, she etches a portrait of malevolence that outdoes the later physical manifestations we see. Kenan knows she can’t be replaced so closely to the source, so instead we get Jared Harris—who did something similar but less effectively in last year’s The Quiet Ones—as legit TV ghost hunter, who’s brought in by Jane Adams’ parasychologist. In a tip of the hat to The Conjuring, Adams turns out to be Harris’ ex-wife, and some of their mutual sniping adds some welcome amusement. Harris and his lilting Irish accent make this new character more of a showman than anything, although uncertainty in his ability lurks at his borders. The new Poltergeist is, in its own right, a fine film that does just about everything the target audience will be looking for it to do. What’s interesting is that Kenan and his team conduct themselves so well that instead of justifying their remake, they only solidify a case against its existence. This movie borrows so much imagery, atmosphere and theme from the first picture that it ends up rendering most of its intended shocks toothless and its conceits tired instead of novel. Carol Ann being swallowed by the television was an original and very clever way of drawing out that underlying fear of an entire generation of children discarded to the babysitting care of the tv set. The original film so expertly played that note because it had the responsibility of its creation; the new movie is only playing riffs on an existing theme, so there’s less danger, less tension, and ultimately less impact. After watching Poltergeist 2015, it’s clear that Kenan and all involved could have made an entirely original work that could stand on its own. Instead they’ve cut the same corners as those morally questionable real estate developers in Cuesta Verda, building their enterprise on the restless spirit of a force that will inevitably come back to haunt them.",MRG_Doc9_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
199,MRG_Doc10_Poltergeist,"HOLLYWOOD and remakes. The words go hand­in­hand. If it's not a superhero film or a sequel of sorts then it's modern retellings of older films. The latest release to be go down this particular path is Tobe Hooper's 1982 Poltergeist. With Steven Spielberg writing, it has become a classic in the eyes of some. For those unacquainted with the original, Gil Kenan's remake may stand a chance of actually entertaining them without being hampered by comparisons or the inability to view it on its own merits. The Bowen family ­ dad Eric (Sam Rockwell), mum Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) and kids Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), Griffin (Kyle Catlett) and Maddy (Kennedi Clements) ­are moving house. In fact, they're downsizing after Eric loses his job at John Deere. Upon moving into their new home ­ which had once been owned by a technophile ­it doesn't take long for youngest child Maddy to begin talking to people who aren't there, while Griffin's fear of the dark and ominous noises ensures he struggles to adapt to the changes. When the spooky goings on begin to escalate little Maddy is sucked into a spiritual plane by malevolent beings leaving the Bowen's with no choice but to turn to TV paranormal investigator Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) for help. Director Kenan, better known for animation Monster House and City of Ember, handles much of Poltergeist with an assured hand. We are given the chance to get to know the family before things go wrong, ensuring we're rooting for them to get Maddy back. All­ too- often the lead characters are insufferable morons that result in the audience not caring about what happens to them. Here, though, Kenan introduces us to a family much like many around the world. Facing financial struggles and issues with their kids, there's a familiarity to them that's endearing. While Rockwell, Harris and DeWitt may be the recognisable names, this is a showcase for both Catlett and Clements, who are tremendous in their respective roles. Catlett brings an awkward uneasiness to Griffin. He's the middle child, he needs a night light and isn't particularly happy about the creepy tree that hangs over the house. In fact his journey is one of redemption, which is an interesting approach for one so young. Blaming himself for Maddy's disappearance, he must find the inner­ strength to help bring her back into the real world. Clements, meanwhile, is superb. She's an explosion of energy whenever she's on screen and brings an air of authenticity to her character. Given how bubbly she is, the moment she repeats that line, made famous by Heather O'Rourke in the original, is well handled without feeling tired or cheap. Both Rockwell and DeWitt are fine as the troubled parents without it ever feeling like they're over­extending themselves. There are moments Rockwell looks bored as Eric, but it's difficult to tell whether that's an issue with the script or his portrayal of a man left jobless with nothing to do at home but deal with the kids. But he does deliver a couple of moments of levity with off­the­cuff lines that should raise a chuckle. Kenan deals with the build­up well. As the ghostly goings on worsen there are tense moments and even a couple of effective jump scares. There's also a neat use of modern technology, in this instance a remote control drone. It's just a shame the good work is undone by an over­reliance on CG effects ­ especially when we enter the other realm which is filled with corpses crawling over each other ­ and a rushed final act. It's this quick wrap­ up job that's most frustrating. It renders what atmosphere and tension there is almost inert, but it keeps its head above water thanks to the performances, especially the introduction of Harris who hams it up quite a bit. One of the more baffling decisions, though, is the addition of 3D. Bar one moment involving a drill, it's completely unnecessary throughout. There are no other scenes that feel like they are improved upon or added to with the inclusion of that third dimension, so don't waste that extra £1 when you do go along to see it. Just opt for 2D. While Poltergeist may not reinvent the wheel it's a fairly enjoyable 90 minutes at the cinema.",MRG_Doc10_Poltergeist,MRG,Horror,Positive,Poltergeist
200,NHS_Doc1_Interstellar,"As someone who never reads reviews and rarely watches trailers before reviewing a film, it was, nonetheless, all but impossible to avoid the buzz surrounding Christopher Nolans first film post-Batman, with the sci-fi epic Interstellar, penned alongside his brother Jonathan, breathlessly dubbed a masterpiece, in some corners.
Jessica Chastain as Murphy. 
Imagine my surprise, then, when a flustered check of my watch as the film finally kicks into orbit revealed were already at the 90-minute mark  its almost three hours long.
Matthew McConaughey is Cooper, a former NASA pilot who, like the rest of the world, has been grounded on an Earth thats slowly choking to death. As crops fail wholesale, the only job that matters is tending to the dying land. Its an interesting enough, if not entirely original, concept that plays on the current political, social and environmental dramas surrounding the current threat of climate change. Unfortunately youll get scant detail here, beyond one intriguing nugget that history has been re-written to suggest the moon landings were faked, in an effort to refocus school kids on the earthly matters at hand.
Instead, we mostly focus on a love story between father Cooper and daughter Murphy, played by a red-haired and full-lipped Mackenzie Foy as a child and the talented Jessica Chastain as a woman. Other family members, including son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow), barely get a look in.
Eventually they are left behind as fate, and a truly odd sequence involving dust and seeming poltergeist-tossed books, leads Cooper to humanitys last hope  a secret NASA space mission run by Michael Caine thats shooting for a wormhole created by strange, otherworldly beings who can manipulate gravity, opening up the real possibility of habitable planets far beyond humanitys current reach.
Anne Hathaway is astronaut Amelia Brand.
The cardboard cut out family is replaced by cardboard cut out astronauts, played with a truly odd lack of depth by Anne Hathaway, David Gyasi and Wes Bentley, plus the welcome vocal talents of Bill Irwin as seriously snarky robot assistant TARS who ironically provides the films only human touch. And thats part of the problem here  none of these characters feel fully-fledged, not even Cooper (stoic hero) and Murphy (whiny kid). Theyre here to fulfil dramatic purpose, rather than explore genuine emotional depths. Indeed, for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, its alarming how lacking it is in this department and certainly makes the inordinate run-time a big ask.
Where it excels, eventually, is in the truly breathtaking journey into the stars and beyond, with Nolan once again pulling out the Inception-style wow factor, this time on 70mm film, thats missing in his more grounded superhero movies. But even here it feels a little like cheating, owing a huge visual debt to 2001: A Space Odyssey almost to the point of plagiarism, particularly with the spinning space station.
While both planets visited, a tsunami-plagued waterworld and Hoth-like wasteland complete with frozen clouds, are pretty to look at, again, theres very little to these adventures. Major incidents occur, but their effect is scantly grappled with, beyond a nice focus on gravitys influence on time, meaning that their families back home age much more rapidly in their absence.
Again, other than a few (illogical) video messages that I doubt would have been approved by executive producer Kip Thorne, the celebrated theoretical physicist, this isnt really capitalised on. The emotive stuff rarely moves beyond Hallmark platitudes about a father saving the world for this daughter, hammered home by repetitive and awkward quoting of Dylan Thomass Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. Its left to Hans Zimmers startling, organ-led score to do much of the heavy lifting.
Never quite as clever or as emotionally engaging as Nolan clearly thinks it is, there is awe here, but no real wonder. In truth, its closer in tone to last years technically excellent, thrilling if not fulfilling Gravity than it is to Kubricks grand space opera. While it will no doubt find willing audiences and rightfully soar in the technical categories of the Oscars, Interstellar ultimately comes back down to earth with a thud, and a feeling that its one very expensive bucket of popcorn, leaving you hungry for something more nourishing.

201,NHS_Doc2_Interstellar,"Ive been a Beatles fan since I was something like eight years old, but it took me until somewhere in my late 20s to realize I preferred The White Album to my previous favorite Beatles albums, Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road. It wasnt that I was possessed by a heretofore unrealized dislike for those records  far from it. Extensive return visits had confirmed that theyre pretty much perfect pop albums, the songwriting, production, and performance all tip-top. The White Album is not perfect. Its a double album when a single would certainly have sufficed, filled with tracks that vary from goofy (Martha My Dear, Dont Pass Me By) to bizarre (Bungalow Bill, Wild Honey Pie) to fucking unlistenable (Revolution 9).
But because its so big and weird and experimental, it reaches heights that are unimaginable within the tightly constructed confines of something like Sgt. Pepper; that ambition is why we get a haunting near-dirge like Long Long Long or a novelty lark like Back in the USSR or a gonzo rocker like Everybodys Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey. The White Album isnt tight or disciplined; its messy, in conception and execution. And this is a long way of getting around to saying that Christopher Nolans new film Interstellar doesnt have the crispness of Inception or the jangly momentum of The Dark Knight. Its his White Album, overlong and overwritten, corny and self-important, and also a great movie. And yes, it can be all of those things at once.
 
Yet because it is the work of Nolan, who has quietly become one of our more oddly divisive filmmakers, you will probably hear one of two things about Interstellar: that it is a mind-blowing act of God that cures cancer and inspires prose poetry, or that it is a total self-indulgent bust. Correction: you may hear a third, even less interesting perspective, that it has not met expectations for sweeping dominance among year-end awards, the increasingly tired rubric by which all fall movies must be scored. (Its one thing to get this kind of gaseous prick-measuring from a blowhard like Jeff Wells; its another thing altogether when the Times gets in on the act.)
But what makes Interstellar interesting and noteworthy and at least a little bit great is that its none of those things  its a deeply flawed movie of expansive ideas and emotions whose reach exceeds its grasp, which is understandable, as it is grasping for a science fiction encapsulation of the agony of parenthood, the power of love, the meaning of life, and the inevitability of death. It contains more echoes than were accustomed to from Nolan: I caught whiffs of E.T., Alien, Contact, Moon, (obviously) 2001, and (surprisingly) Reds, but those are just the most transparent ones. As a result, it feels oddly pieced-together, less the sound of his singular voice, and that voice leans rather heavily on clich, particularly in the opening hour (which has a bit too much of Matthew McConaughey gettin all misty-eyed and drawlin about how were supposedtabe explorers).
 
But there are interesting things happening even in that pokey first act, which is built on a simple but clever idea: what does a dystopian future, usually seen in cluttered Blade Runner-y cityscapes, look like in the heartland? And once McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and their crew launch into space, Nolan finds his footing; he seizes on the eerie quiet of their surroundings, creates stunning images (overwhelming on the big IMAX screen), and in several scenes, accomplishes something exceedingly rare in our seen-it-all cinema: a genuine sense of wonder. Meanwhile, its closing scenes are reminiscent  and look, Im fully aware this is not a ringing endorsement for a great many viewers  of AI, where an obviously elongated conclusion ultimately arrives at a place of genuine emotion and power.
In those passages, and many others not worth spoiling here, Nolan is (forgive the schlocky shout-out to the narrative) exploring uncharted territory, and its thrilling to not know where hes going, to see him taking these kinds of chances, sometimes unsteadily. Hes willing to fail here, rather spectacularly, and that openness conversely allows him a different kind of success. The phrase points for trying is often used dismissively, as though trying (and failing) isnt part of an artists growth, as if we demand great work never lets the seams show, that makes it all seem to come naturally, that we must never see filmmakers striving for greatness and thus breaking a sweat. (You can read a lot of this between the lines of those outlying Birdman takedowns.)
Interstellar represents forward movement for a director who could very well have spent this year making another smooth, slick thriller like Inception or The Prestige or, God help us, Batman v Superman. Yet he made this instead, and it is a gorgeous, ambitious, risky, brainy piece of work. If its also clumsily sentimental and mildly overcooked, well, hey, points for trying.

202,NHS_Doc3_Interstellar,"Interstellar begins more or less after the end. More or less, because the talking heads telling us about the end are evidently speaking from some later point in time, reminiscing about the doomed environment we are about to enteran early signal that this movie will be a zone in which beginnings can never be presumed to precede endings. From what we can make out, civilization is smashed, in the wake of an apocalypse triggered by the effects of advanced technology. In a post-Federal Middle America, the surviving inhabitants cultivate cornfields as a last-ditch source of nourishment in the face of encroaching blights and dust storms that must soon render the Earth uninhabitable.
We become aware of lone individuals who may have it in them to redeem the lost world: Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot who still dreams of space exploration, and his precocious young daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), who receives mysterious communications from what she believes to be a ghost or poltergeist. The signals from beyond are directing them toward a secret installation where scientists under the tutelage of a great astrophysicist (Michael Caine) work to perfect a means to escape from the dying Earth. The professors project requires sending Cooper, with a crew that includes the professors own daughter, Brand (Anne Hathaway), on a mission into another galaxy located somewhere in the vicinity of Saturn.
Yet as Cooper and his shipmates proceed into the farther reaches of their voyageagainst a backdrop of spacecraft control panels and air hatches, moving at times through Kubrickian arcades of cosmic warp, alighting on worlds that are all mountainous waves or locked in icethere is the deepening sense of approaching the limits of a livable human relation to space and time even while continuing by reflex to go through the motions of being human. They have reached the point where they can drop down from the spaceship onto a world where time passes at a different rate, and come back a few hours later to find out that theyve been gone for 23 years. Im not afraid of death, someone says, Im afraid of time.
 
The whole movie comes to a stop for a moment with the blunt force of times horror and the insuperable barrier of human lifespan. We crosscut between parallel narratives and parallel galaxies, as the odds of bridging the abyss seem increasingly narrow. The arc of personal storythe drama of daughters abandonment by father evolving toward the drama of fathers rescue by daughteris twined around the more elusive arc of wormhole physics with its promise of connections between points remote from each other in space and time.
Having set out to be a journey into what can hardly be depicted at all, Interstellar must find oblique ways of suggesting further imperceptible dimensions of the real. It is worth the journey to see what Nolan has constructed as a model of the unknowable. The end-of-the-world story changes into a beginning-of-the-world story, an optimistic paean to hidden human capabilities, holding out the possibility of a scarcely imaginable multidimensional future for the specieseven if that future may require jettisoning much of what is supposed to be intrinsic to human identity.
The ghost story becomes a story of resurrection. Yet the ostensible optimism is underscored by a sustained note of mournful anxiety, with Dylan Thomass vibrant unconsoled threnody Do not go gentle into that good night repeatedly invoked. We are brought at last to an extraordinary transgalactic reunion at the brink of dissolution, an Einsteinian variant on the last scene of Mizoguchis Sansho the Bailiff. True to its obsession with recursive temporal arcs, Interstellar is a narrative that reveals itself not so much in the telling as in the playing back, as we make contact with an ending that was already the point of departure.

203,NHS_Doc4_Interstellar,"In an interview in The Guardian this week, Christopher Nolan mused: What Ive found is, people who let my films wash over themwho dont treat it like a crossword puzzle, or like there is a test afterwardsthey get the most out of the film. Thats a fair enough approach to cinema, although hearing it from this director may come as a surprise to anyone who spent time furrowing their brows over the logic of the backwards storytelling in Memento, or that closing shot of the spinning top in Inception. For those of us who earn our living writing about cinema, there usually is a test of sorts after watching movies, and with Nolans work, theres often the temptation to concentrate on solving the crossword of his narratives, to figure out whether or not all the squares really can be filled in coherently.
Not that, as a rule, I care so much about whether narrative hangs together: there are usually more involving things to discuss in any film. But I wont even try to make sense of the logic of Interstellar. Given that much of the story seems to hang on the rules of quantum mechanicson the relation of time to mass, velocity, black holes, and so forthIll leave the unpicking of that to people more qualified than I am on the topic. And Id imagine that Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan are themselves pretty qualified by now, given that their adviser (and executive producer) on Interstellar is eminent theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. So if you feel that anything in the film doesnt quite make sense, you might want to consider what the Nolans ample scientific expository dialogue has to say about the problem of incommensurable theories, and then give up on worrying too much about Interstellars hard-science aspect. You might want to just think about whether Interstellar works as something that, as Nolan recommends, washes over you. But, much as I went into Interstellar with goodwill, ready to immerse myself in the oceanic vastness of a 70mm IMAX projectionwell, Im afraid the film and its visionary aspirations simply didnt wash with me.
The premise is dead simple, although it gathers some mind-bending complications along the waynarrative complications, that is, rather than the intellectual complexities which quite a few critics have seen in it (including Vivian Sobchack, who has hailed the films complex multidimensionality in the new November/December issue). The setting: the American Midwest sometime in the future. Earths crops are failing as a result of a global blight, and humanity has abandoned wars to concentrate on agriculture. But some still dream of what lies beyond our planet, including Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an ex-NASA pilot turned corn farmer, whose young daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) shares his dream. As Cooper huskily muses, in McConaugheys aw-shucksiest down-home drawl to date: We used to look up in the sky and wonder about our place in the stars. Now we just look down and wonder about our place in the dust. Hard to know if this is only Coopers elegy for faded dreams of space exploration, or Nolans complaint because people keep telling him that one of these days he should tone down the genre bombast and make a nice sensible piece of earthbound realism.
 
While giant clouds of dust loom menacingly, Murph muses that a ghost is trying to communicate with her in a book-lined room in her familys Andrew Wyethesque farmhouse. Of course its not a ghost, Cooper says, reminding her of the imperatives of rationalism: Record the facts analyze present your conclusions. But something appears to be talking to Murph in dust, and in codeand in the films first wild leap of credibility, father and daughter read some lines on the floor as map coordinates, jump in their jeep, and keep driving until they reach a metal fence. Behind it is the secret HQ of NASA itself, where Michael Caine, as scientist Professor Brand, has been waiting for them. NASA has not in fact been outlawed, as wed been told, but has been working on a project to send astronauts through a wormhole into another galaxy, to seek out new planets for humanity to live on. Brand has very nearly cracked the problem of gravity on his formulae-scrawled array of old-fashioned blackboards (a metaphor, you imagine, for Nolans own favored analogue approach to image-making), and the ships ready to go up: all thats needed is an intrepid astronaut to lead the voyage. I cant tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft, says Brandand the deals done, making this the most casual recruitment for a space project since the Tintin book Destination Moon.
Given the initial emphasis on rationalism, the expository style at NASA veers weirdly between nerd science and wide-eyed mysticism. On one hand, theres a wormhole to fly throughand just how these phenomena work is helpfully explained by crewman Romilly (David Gyasi) using a piece of paper with a hole punched in it. On the other hand, the wormhole itself has a touch of the unearthly, in more ways than one: its positioned so conveniently, somewhere beyond Saturn, that the boffins can only conclude, Someone placed it thereto which Anne Hathaway, as Brands daughter Amelia, adds: Whoever they are, theyre looking out for us. In fact, although faith plays a big part in this story, its not really religious faith so much as trust in good old human determination, as embodied by plucky, level-headed types like Cooper and Murph (as stubborn as her old man). Or, as someone puts it, mulling over the question of saving humanity: Well find a way like we always have.
So Coopers crew head into the unknown, accompanied by a defiantly non-anthropomorphic pair of robots (one of them voiced by Bill Irwin), which you could picture as a minimalist strain of Transformer, made out of rectilinear metal blocks that nevertheless fold and unfold in an ingeniously unshowy fashion. The robots also have variable settings for human characteristics including humorwhich might be Nolans dry way of acknowledging the oft-voiced complaint that hes never had much of a funny bone. And so, as Caines solemn face fills the ships monitor (shades of the frowning on-screen visages of Solaris) and he starts to intone Dylan Thomass Do not go gentle into that good night, the intergalactic awe begins
 
And Im not jokingthere really are a number of vistas in this film that are as gorgeous as any space-scapes previously seen in science-fiction cinema. Theres a wonderful shot when Earths expanse sprawls vastly over the screen, and another in which Saturn with all its rings glides by, sharp and gorgeous, accompanied by flashes of lens flare. There are also more abstract imaginings: the wormhole, actually a shiny sphere in appearance, provides the films own Stargate sequence  la 2001, the ships cascade down it resembling a tumble down a swimming-pool flume at night. A singularity is also imagined as a sort of deconstructed waterfall of fire.
But its once our explorers pass into another galaxy that things take on a new dimension of banality and the film, however magnificently conceived in visual terms, becomes just another space adventure. They land on one planet that seems all sea, only to face mountain-high wavesat which point the film turns into The Perfect Storm. Another planet resembles the surface of Iceland (where this sequence was shot), with the addition of frozen clouds like icebergs suspended in mid-air. There, for reasons I couldnt quite work out, a previous explorer (played by an uncredited major star: IMDb it unless youre spoiler-averse) attempts to sabotage Coopers mission, and suddenly were into a hyper-austere remake of Lost in Space.
Theres nothing wrong in itself with flipping between these different modes of adventure, especially because Nolans analogue styleshooting on celluloid, minimizing digital illusiongives even the more other-worldly episodes a distinctive edge of concrete realism. As designed by Nathan Crowley and shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the hardware especially looks like hardwaremetal that seems heavy, cumbersome and breakable, as distinct from the aesthetic of weightlessness promoted by most contemporary CGI futurism. Yet the flip side of this deglamorizing tendency is a banalization of the space experience: the explorers seem to get to the wormhole in no time at all, and theyre in that other galaxy (Were here!) as easily as they might change subway lines. (You keep thinking theyll pass Sandra Bullock, floating by with a neighborly wave.) That Nolan later starts cutting easily between events in the other galaxy and on Earth is ostensibly a daring move, but in fact it further domesticates the drama, the simultaneity of action (e.g., cutting between a spaceship revving up and a speeding car in the Midwest) somehow reducing the two narrative strands to the same level of mundanity.
 
Theres a further element that has been acclaimed as profoundly daring, and that is the trick of having different events run in parallel, but at different speedssomething Nolan previously did with the reality-within-reality-within-reality mise en abymes of Inception. Here we learn that time on Earth and in parts of space, notably on planets of radically different mass, runs at different speeds, so that on the water planet, as Romilly explains, Every hour we spend . . . will be seven years back on Earth . . . Thats relativity, folks. (Something similar also holds for cinema, I suppose, which is why the average Lav Diaz film is actually infinitely shorter than Guardians of the Galaxy.) That means that, while Cooper barely ages on his mission, his daughter Murph grows up to be Jessica Chastain, and his son to be Casey Affleck, and he gets heart-tugging messages from them, prompting thoughts of love, distance, and mortality. Do not go gentle is heard again, and yet again, and a lachrymose tone creeps in, this films substitute for genuine emotional depth.
What happens at the climax is barely describable: suffice to say that Cooper plunges boldly into a singularity, emerging in an alternative dimension thats weirder by far than the peerlessly haunting place where 2001 finally led us, and that seems to be visually and conceptually modeled on one of the best-known Jorge Luis Borges stories. The payoff is that love and old-fashioned book-learning will conquer all. The coda seems to go on foreverneatly illustrating the concept of times elasticityand once 165 minutes are over, youll either be left gasping at the metaphysical and scientific amplitude of the films vision, or youll be muttering my favorite line in it through gritted teeth: This data makes no sense!
All credit to Nolans ambition, and his dauntless why not? energy. But the scale of Interstellars execution sits ill with the banality of so much of it, and made me think of other science-fiction films that once made me marvel and filled me with a melancholy sense of the universe as a place of deep, haunting solitude: 2001 most ineffably, but also what you might call the econo-sci-fi likes of Silent Running, Dark Star, and most recently Duncan Joness Moon, all pragmatically executed, pared down and yet mustering a massively deep, sad resonance. Interstellar, by contrast, boosts its own resonance with a Hans Zimmer score that sometimes strikingly, sometimes all too overpoweringly, hits us with a distinctive mix of strings and church organ (when Cooper takes his big moment-of-truth ride, the score swells up like a turbo-charged Liebestod).
 
For all its aspiration to the sublime, Interstellar cant escape the ridiculous. The characters, and consequently the acting, rarely transcend comic-strip simplicity; Coopers family inhabit their own belt of purest corn somewhere between Field of Dreams and Ray Bradbury at his folksiest. Admittedly, theres something boldly simple about proposing to represent our apocalyptic near future and only showing us a rural patch of America, rather than cutting to the gasping multitudes from Canberra to Kolkata, as Roland Emmerich would have done. Yet my Brit sensibility recoils at the idea of an English director so wholeheartedly embracing American myth that he can cheerfully present us with the idea that the destiny of our entire species is being forged in a Midwestern cornfield.
But thats all part of the films crazy oscillation between the infinite and the domestic, between the imponderable Beyond and the cozy old backyard (making Interstellar more than a little Malickian). As the older Murph says, in another choice bit of dialogue: If theres an answer here on Earth, its back there in that room. Somehow I have to find it! The answer indeed is found in the form of magnetism, gravity, and love: Love isnt something weve invented, its observable, powerful . . . Love is the one thing that were capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Hmm. Well, excuse me for being cold-blooded in my critiquebut someone has to stand up for Record the facts analyze present your conclusions.

204,NHS_Doc5_Interstellar,"Yes, I recognize the egregious tardiness of this review. Interstellar has been out for over a week now. Ive started and stopped writing about it a good, solid half dozen times, including a three-day hiatus while I was at a ladies getaway weekend in Palm Springs with a bunch of school moms. Being functional was not on the agenda.
Now its time to buckle down and dig in, and Ill try to do it with both the brevity and directness Christopher Nolans film is lacking.
Its a tricky thing, writing about Interstellar. Nolans latest provokes intense and conflicting reactions, more so than any of his previous films. (And for the record, Ive been a fan  I love Memento, Inception and The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises, not so much, as you may have heard.) Its a film I didnt exactly enjoy and cant say I would recommend. And yet as an event, as a singular movie-watching opportunity, its undoubtedly worthwhile. How often do you get the chance to see a film projected in 70mm IMAX? Its awesome and overwhelming, but also overbearing and ultimately kind of silly. But thats only the beginning of the contradictions, which are many and maddening.
Nolans space odyssey features some truly striking imagery, and you certainly have to appreciate that he remains a fervent champion of shooting on film. (Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose previous beautiful work includes Spike Jonzes Her and the original Swedish vampire thriller Let the Right One in, is the cinematographer.) Individual moments of grandeur are jaw-dropping, including the sight of a spaceship passing as a tiny blip against a massive Saturn and its rings in various shades of brown and gray. But strangely, other shots  including some of the exterior of the ship against a vast blackness, or docking into a space station  look conspicuously like models.
Interstellar boasts a strong cast filled with Oscar winners and nominees, and it places them in scenarios which are sprawling in their ambitions and dizzying in their scientific complexity. But then the dialogue theyre stuck working with often inspires either dozing or unintended giggling. The script  which Nolan wrote with his brother and frequent collaborator, Jonathan Nolan  is terrible. It alternates between dry and expository high-tech jargon and weepy, overly simplistic notions of love. Nolan is not exactly known as the most emotional director  although I appreciate the clockwork precision of his filmmaking  but here, when he tries to get a little gushy, the result is just laughable.
That gushiness also comes with the accompaniment of a typically insistent Hans Zimmer score (which is different from the signature WHOMMM from Inception, FYI). But Interstellar also suffers from some muddled sound issues. You may find yourself straining to hear the dialogue at times  not that youll necessarily want to hear it.
Another frustrating inconsistency comes from the films pacing, which alternates between draggy and relentless. It takes a long time to establish this post-apocalyptic near future, a withering place where farming has replaced technology as the planets primary purpose. And then, poof! Matthew McConaugheys character is saying good-bye to his kids and heading into space, having been asked to commandeer a dangerous mission within minutes of discovering NASAs clandestine headquarters.
McConaugheys Cooper is a widowed former astronaut now living in a modest farmhouse with his inquisitive daughter, Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), his teenage son, Tom (Timothee Chalamet), and his circumspect father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow). Its a world where the powers that be are erasing the accomplishments of the past, and where regular folks are struggling to survive just one more day. (The massive, Steinbeckian dust storms that smother and swallow everything are a frightening sight to behold.) As is the case with most McConaughey characters, Cooper gets by on his charm; Interstellar requires him to deliver many intricate lines, but doesnt ask him to stray too far beyond his confident, charismatic persona. His strongest moments actually come when hes playfully bantering on Earth with the spitfire Foy and earnestly promising hell come home to her.
A series of mysterious signs leads Cooper and Murphy to NASAs underground operations, and to some semblance of hope. As they learn from the dignified gentleman who runs the place, Professor Brand (Michael Caine, Nolans go-to voice of reason), a dozen brave pioneers shipped out a few years ago in search of other planets that might be habitable. They accessed these far-away lands through a wormhole near Saturn, which space aliens may or may not have placed there as a gift. (Whos to say? Aliens are mysterious creatures.) Now, Cooper has the opportunity to save all of humanity by hopping inside a rocket with a group of brilliant scientists  as well as a clunky but omniscient HAL 9000-like robot named TARS, voiced by Bill Irwin  by visiting three of these planets which seem like the safest destinations.
The only one of these supporting characters who gets much of a discernible personality is Brands daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway). Interstellar goes out of its way to establish her as supremely qualified for this mission  one of the top experts in her field  which is commendable. But eventually, the film reveals that it doesnt think much of its women as it undermines both her and Jessica Chastains character, who arrives much later as the grown-up version of Murphy once decades have passed on Earth. (Theres a convoluted space-time continuum issue which complicates matters.) Both women are clearly geniuses, yet they make decisions based on romantic impulses which seem not just contradictory to their natures but stereotypically chickish. If I were an astronaut, Id be seriously offended.
Eventually, there is a massive, third-act twist. Im not going to ruin it (although I have a theory about whats actually going on with it). Regardless, it feels like a cheat, and it doesnt work. Interstellar begins life with great aspirations and originality, but it ultimately devolves into a sorta-clever Twilight Zone episode. Still, if youre going to see it, you may as well do so on the biggest screen you can find. Unfortunately, it wont stay with you for long afterward.

205,NHS_Doc6_Interstellar,"The title of Christopher Nolans behemoth space epic says it all  a grandiloquent declaration of scale that smacks simultaneously of ambition and hubris  like Titanic, both the ship and the film. The good news is that this flawed but frequently awe-inspiring movie about wormholes and black holes does not implode into a dark star of disappointment; if its spectacle you want, then Interstellar delivers, particularly when viewed in Nolans preferred 70mm Imax format.
Yet while the films massive gravitational pull guarantees astronomical box-office returns, fans of Nolans finest works (Memento, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Inception) will long for more narrative rigour as raw science, rich sentimentality and rank silliness battle for the heart and soul of this very personal project. As a diehard Nolanoid, I found myself largely enthralled, often amazed and occasionally aghast.
Seamlessly amalgamating his own semi-formed stories about space travel with a script that his brother Jonathan (Jonah) had been developing for Steven Spielberg, Nolans long-gestating magnum opus is a futuristic fable firmly rooted in the age-old traditions of sci-fi. We open in a dust-bowl dystopian future where blighted food supplies are dwindling and inhabitable Earth is dying. Harking back to Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylies 1933 novel When Worlds Collide (a Depression-era text brought to the screen by producer George Pal in the 1950s), Nasa builds a space ark  a giant ship that will take mankind to a new home in the stars, provided the problem of gravity can be solved by avuncular Professor Brand (Michael Caine).
Meanwhile, Right Stuff-style pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is prompted by ghostly forces to lead an exploratory mission through a wormhole beyond the rings of Saturn, abandoning his family in search of a future for all humanity. What follows is a dizzying mash-up of The Haunting, Slaughterhouse-Five, Silent Running, Event Horizon and the directors cut of Aliens, with the inverted time shifts of Inception (an hour on a distant planet equals lost years back on Earth) thrown in for extra emotional heft.
While its temptingly easy to cite 2001 (anything invoking a dimensional star gate triggers rarely positive Kubrick comparisons), the movie that hangs over Interstellar like the dust cloud atmospherically engulfing its earthbound scenes is Contact, with which it shares much more than just leading man McConaughey. Adapted from a novel by Carl Sagan (with signature input from Interstellars theoretical physicist Kip Thorne), Robert Zemeckiss 1997 epic similarly centred on a daughter crying out to a lost father whose soul seems to abide somewhere across the universe.
In both movies, it is these daughters who detect the first stirrings of an alien encounter: Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) identifying recurrent sequences in the white noise of interstellar radiation in Contact; Murph (very affectingly played in her younger years by Mackenzie Foy) spying morse code in poltergeist disturbances in Interstellar. From such discoveries are missions launched, voyaging across time and space at the apparent instruction of a superior intelligence offering cryptic hands across the universe.
Intergalactic portals are breached, timescales bifurcated, science and faith reconciled. Crucially, for all their astro-maths exposition, the constant in both stories is neither time, space, nor gravity, but love. More than once I was reminded of Contacts Ellie striking the outer limits of the universe and breathlessly declaring: They should have sent a poet. In dispatching Nolan beyond the stars, thats exactly what theyve done.
Despite the clunkiness of its dialogue (would an astronaut really need to have wormholes explained to him just as he approached one?) and ludicrousness of its plot (I can only accept the final 15 minutes if its all an illusion  which I suspect it isnt), Interstellar is the work of someone who dreams with their eyes wide open. There is no one working in cinema today who has as much faith in the overwhelming power of the image as Nolan and who trusts their audience to be similarly awestruck. Like visionary film-maker Douglas Trumbull (who conjured 2001s most memorable effects), Nolans primary register is light, and one can legitimately trace his love of celluloid back to the earliest experiments of Georges Mlis, who first used movies to send us on A Trip to the Moon in 1902. Watching Insterstellar, I felt connected to a century of mind-boggling spectacular cinema  to films such as The Ten Commandments, The Robe and Ben-Hur, which made you catch your breath at the sheer scope and intensity of the imagery. As Roy Batty says in Blade Runner: I have seen things you people wouldnt believe...
Whether such ocular delights are enough to assuage any anxieties about the plot remains a moot point. Critics and audiences turned their noses up at Transcendence, the directorial debut from Nolans long-time director of photography Wally Pfister (here replaced by keen-eyed Hoyte van Hoytema) which was sneeringly dismissed by many as Inception-lite. Yet there is nothing in Pfisters nostalgically ambitious directorial debut that is any more foolish than the heavily signposted twists and turns of Nolans latest.
Similarly, Gravity may have seemed philosophically flimsier, but it made more sense (and arguably pushed the visual effects envelope further) than Interstellar. Nolans regular composer Hans Zimmer has the measure of the madness, cooking up an eerie score that swerves from the creaky Goblin-esque horrors of mid-period Dario Argento to the imposing hallelujahs of what sounds like a massive church organ.
While the end result may not represent the pinnacle of Nolans extraordinary career, it nevertheless reaffirms him as cinemas leading blockbuster auteur, a director who can stamp his singular vision on to every frame of a gargantuan team effort in the manner of Spielberg, Cameron and Kubrick. Whose subconscious are we in? asked Ellen Page in Inception. The answer here, as always, is unmistakably Nolans.

By the time Christopher Nolan gets to that moment, hes already contorted the plot enough times to deliver on a promise of entertainment. Weve seen Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway put on space suits and fling themselves across the universe; weve experienced a new, maybe more accurate representation of wormholes. There are robot sidekicks with settings for humor and discretion that look like a brainteaser had a baby with the Monolith from 2001; theres the appearance of an unbilled movie star who injects some real poignancy and suspense.
Interstellar asks  in all seriousness  Are we there yet? And what does there even mean? Once this movie got to where it was going (that takes about two and a half hours), I had an involuntary spasm of laughter. What else could I do? Partly, I laughed at the cleverness of the revelation. The sequence delivers. And partly, I laughed because Nolan believes cleverness is the same thing as audacity. He thinks that the click of realization is profound, that its the key  when, really, its just the gears of a giant machine locking into place. All of this effort, all of these questions, all of this movie, and for what? There is no there there.
Nolan might like to think that, with Memento, The Prestige, Inception, and now Interstellar, hes exploring important existential questions (and, frequently writing with his brother Jonathan, he actually is), but theres always the sense that the person making these movies has no sense of thematic proportionality. The about is out of whack with the what. These movies are about Loss. Theyre about Love. Theyre also spiritually generic. They require a lot of production just to make change rhyme with rearrange. With Interstellar, you know youre in for it when, in the opening scenes, its clear the movie is about Family  the mythic farm family, the stuff of paintings and WPA photographs. Not America, per se, but Americana.
The Nolans plant some actual characters onto that landscape, but its too arid for anything interesting to grow. McConaughey plays Joseph Coop Cooper, a widowed engineer whose ace piloting skills are as vestigial as this movies Field of Dreams version of baseball now appears to be. The government of the agrarian state needs him to farm corn, which he does with his father-in-law (John Lithgow) and two kids, 10-year-old Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and teenage Tom (Timothe Chalamet). The planet is down to its last drops. Crackpots are teaching junk history in the schools. Children are being told they can only become farmers. And the air is increasingly rich with gas that will soon cause everyone to suffocate. Interspersed amid the early action are documentary clips featuring older folks (including one played by Ellen Burstyn) who recall years of blight and one particularly cataclysmic dust storm. Theyre like interviews from a Ken Burns film playing in a gallery at some historical museum.
The story begins well after whatever environmental catastrophe wiped out much of mankind, but just in time for the last okra harvest. Now the only thing left to grow is corn, suggesting that Nolan has either a great sense of self-deprecating irony or none. Murph believes ghosts haunt their farmhouse. How else to explain the books that leap from the shelf in her bedroom to the floor? Coop tells Murph to turn to science to explain the ghosts. Perhaps the ghosts were what inspired him to hop into his pickup truck, drive to the middle of nowhere, and stumble upon the secret headquarters of NASA, which, because agriculture has trumped aeronautics, functions as an immense underground laboratory.
That happens to be where scientists, including a professor named Brand (Michael Caine), have been working for years to find earthlings a new home on a distant planet. A handful of manned probes have been sent up for exploration. One system is showing potential, and Coop is asked to pilot a confirmation mission (on a ship called Endurance) that includes Brands daughter Amelia (Hathaway), an astrophysicist (David Gyasi), a geographer (Wes Bentley), and that pair of robots, the talkier of which is voiced drolly by Bill Irwin. The rub of the mission is the matter of relativity. What hours are to the Endurance crew are years back on Earth. The longer they take to get answers, the older their loved ones will get.
Sadly, until Foy ages into Jessica Chastain, you dont care to spend much time at NASA, and even then youre just waiting for Nolan to get to the good stuff. As Endurance powers through wormholes and enters inhospitable environments, the director gets to dazzle just as he did with all of the larcenous burrowing in Inception. That movie went down. Interstellar goes out. What Nolan lacks in intellectual and emotional depth, he makes up for in pliable vastness. (He does more refolding than a stock girl at the Gap.) But at his best, he makes you believe that the worlds hes inventing have no end, and that time and space truly are as manipulable as he claims.
Nolans cosmic wonder is tethered to so much hoariness. No one does anything in one time frame that doesnt eventually bear upon another moment. Everyone speaks in portents, with nostalgia and lament. Lithgows character remembers when mankind was trying to create and invent. We were doers, he says, not caretakers. When Murph complains to Coop that the kids at school teasingly assume she was named after Murphys Law, he has to explain what that is. The best interactions in the movie occur much later, when theres more at stake, and Chastain and Hathaway get something to play. Wounded anger might be to Chastain what melisma is to Mariah Carey: home. In the thick of the mission, Coop and Amelia are surprised by a practical dilemma  the Endurance has the capacity for only one more wormhole jaunt, and has to choose between two destinations. Amelia has a personal reason for preferring one. The other is a more random crapshoot. They argue over whether her emotional reasoning makes less sense than his pragmatism. The scene gives Hathaway an opportunity for her eyes to go glassy and for her goosey manner to sour. Everything imposing about her comes from the narrowing of those eyes. Theyre like phases of the moon. McConaugheys return to space is his first since nearly denying Jodie Foster the opportunity in Contact. He coasts on his cowboy guile here. Hes almost too charismatic for this kind of heartland dystopia, but he modulates effectively.
If only Nolan knew how to build a movie up with emotion that didnt come exclusively from good acting. The farther out Interstellar goes, the more bound to tired feelings it becomes. Fear of never again seeing a parent or a child should get to you more than it does here. But it feels as if father-daughter bonds were the best they could do. Its conceptual and taken for granted rather than explored. The Americana is meant as a kind of shorthand. Coop and Murphs bond across time isnt meant to move; its supposed to represent all such bonds. Nolan is a pop director, but a limited one. For him, a powerful image doesnt exactly involve people and emotion; rather, its about figures in motion. With something like Inception or the last two installments of his Dark Knight trilogy, that power can get to you, even if some of its ultimately senseless. But here, the movie is too notional to be affecting. The most touching thing that occurs involves a character putting his arms around another. Its unexpected  for him, the other characters, and us. Its the one time the film opens into the sort of harrowing existential place that Alfonso Cuarn sustained for all of Gravity.
Interstellar doesnt fully recover from it, and that passage goes off the rails because Nolan feels like he has to give himself an action sequence. But why? For a visionary, hes surprisingly cautious, and some of that caution makes him seem naive. Take all the talk of love in Interstellar  as a feeling, as inspiration, as a physical property. The Swiss Army knife treatment dulls the movies scientific cutting edge. Love is what makes us human. Its also what makes a Subaru a Subaru.
Great outer-space science fiction confronts you with the vastness of a void. It doesnt have any answers, because there are none. Something like Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey operated in discrete movements. I watch it at least once a year, hoping to get closer to a true understanding. But meaning, in any strict sense, is tantalizingly elusive. Kubrick was dreaming, and thats the dream other directors often seem helpless trying to reproduce. So many movies want to evoke Kubricks, but its dispiriting that so few feel free to go as far as he did. Its not just the light show. Its his insistence on creepiness and human smallness and angst. You can go anywhere in the movies. So Kubrick did. The original iterations of Star Wars and Star Trek took up the boundless cause of the space odyssey.
Steven Spielbergs Close Encounters of the Third Kind, from 1977, brought outer space to Earth, but only to present a fathers sugar-free abandonment of his family in order to hang out with aliens as an act of follow-your-bliss heroism. It remains the most movingly obnoxious, completely sincere ending Ive ever seen in a Hollywood movie. What a crazy way to send home an audience. But Spielberg earned that ending. That film was about religious calling and the confirmation of faith. Theres that great moment up at the mountain lab, where the scientists play for the spaceships the five-tone electronic micro-symphony, and theres a cut to Melinda Dillon, up in the rocks, singing along in frustrated rapture. I know that, she says, through tears, all the work and faith and presumed insanity paying off. You get emotional with her.
Spielberg is a wide-shot director. His power as an emotionalist arrives at the moment when it all clicks for everybody, when the personal becomes popular, when belief upends doubt in public, when many become one. Nolan doesnt have Spielbergs skill with framing. But when Nolan is on, he can make the popular private, the immense intimate. Hes also more convincing when circumstances are grim. The Dark Knights nihilism was the most comprehensively persuasive atmosphere hes conjured. He bore into some of those characters, even while building a wider urban world. The atmosphere was viral. When district attorney Harvey Dent becomes the villain Two-Face, its past the films halfway point. Dents girlfriend has just been blown up. He makes an arguably rational embrace of the movies bleakness.
That films characters felt like a breakthrough for Nolan, whos a better puzzle-maker than a pure storyteller. What makes you laugh about him when some of his non-Batman films reach their climax is his apparent belief that the puzzle is doing more work than it is. For me, the mere ingenuity of the puzzle is enough. But its not for him. Hes got to build for his movies the soul that other films are born with. In Interstellar, Nolan pours on and misconstrues Dylan Thomass Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, refurbishes warped dreamscapes from Inception, and ends the film three times. The images photographed in 70mm Imax, by Hoyte Van Hoytema, are as gorgeous as youd expect. (The many non-Imax shots look sludgy at that scale.) But the incongruity becomes funny. He doesnt realize these people just arent as cool or compelling as outer space. While youre sitting there with McConaughey hovering in a mild panic (this man does not freak out) and Nolans grand machine of a movie has just clicked into place, it occurs to you that, for all the relativity and eternity, Interstellar itself is small. It gives you everything you want in a vision of the future, everything except awe.

207,NHS_Doc8_Interstellar,"Interstellar is M. Night Shyamalans finest film. It blends the aching, yearning, Hallmark-flavored sentimentality, the melodramatic plot twists and the pseudo-profound philosophical reversals with some surprising nuggets of cutting-edge hard science and a view of the human future grounded in both realism and hope. It hits all the notes a Shyamalan fan could hope for: Its about an all-American farm family in the Corn Belt struggling through hard times, its about a grand intergalactic adventure whose real subject is family and love, and its got numerous scenes of major movie stars trying to hold back the tears but not succeeding. Anne Hathaway sobs, Jessica Chastain sobs and Matthew McConaughey sobs. Hell, Matt Damon sobs buckets  and the fact that hes even in this movie was a well-protected secret until the reviews started to hit. Those people do their crying at different and irreconcilable points on the space-time continuum; now we know how water got from place to place in the universe.
Yeah, I know: I dragged out that gag a bit too long, and Shyamalan had nothing to do with Interstellar. He'll be seeing it in a movie theater, like you and me. So this is the greatest Shyamalan movie ever made by someone else, or maybe its Christopher Nolans best impression of what a Shyamalan movie ought to be like. No doubt that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but I dont entirely mean it that way. Whether you think Interstellar is Nolans big breakthrough to a new level of emotional populism or a sideways slide into mainstream glop is largely a function of your perspective on this talented illusionist and his entire career. Oh, and heres the warning: Im going to discuss some conceptual elements of Interstellar that some people may understand as spoilers, but I promise I wont go beyond the barest plot synopsis.
Nolans core fans, if theyre honest with themselves, will feel conflicted about Interstellar, and some may feel subtly let down. This is a tremendous popcorn flick, loaded with thrills and chills, along with plenty of film-school references for those who wish to chase them. But the hard-edged technophilia and post-adolescent nihilism of the Dark Knight trilogy are dialed down almost to zero. This movies exciting, and sometimes moving, but Im not sure how cool it is. Theres another obvious reference point, besides Shyamalan, in mainstream cinema: Jonathan Nolan, Christophers brother and co-writer, first developed this script in the mid-2000s as a project for Steven Spielberg, and the finished product carries the grand ambition, pop calculation and fatal hubris of a Spielbergian spectacle. (The Spielberg version of ""Interstellar"" would of course star Tom Cruise, and here and there you can feel McConaughey fending off that specter.) Has Christopher Nolan grown increasingly desperate to win that elusive Oscar, and made a decision to go for the heart rather than the brain? Maybe a little, but Im not saying Interstellar is a cynical move. Its more like trying out a new persona, that of A-list Hollywood director rather than beloved cult genius. It fits, or pretty close.
Lets start with the big picture: Interstellar, which is sure to be one of the biggest box-office draws of the year and a probable Oscar nominee, is terrific roller-coaster entertainment, with some plot twists youll see a mile away and others that sneak up on you. Despite some awkward expository dialogue where people tell each other things they already know -- Hey, remember when the rain stopped and the crops failed and we had to give up technology just to keep ourselves alive? Member that?  the Nolan brothers screenplay ingeniously unpacks a series of scientific and/or supernatural riddles that at first seem incompatible. Theres just enough quantum mechanics for physics geeks to admit that the films space-travel scenario is halfway or hypothetically plausible (physicist Kip Thorne served as a script consultant), and just enough deep-background deistic teleology for those who want to dream of a Grand Design.
After a leisurely earth-bound liftoff  maybe a bit too leisurely -- we visit wormholes, black holes, forbidding alien worlds and time-space paradoxes. As youd expect, Nolans effects team does stunning, even superlative work, advancing classic images and tropes of science fiction into a new era. This is Nolans first film with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (of Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), and the pictures have an appealing rawness, a notch or two more naturalistic than the perfect sheen delivered by longtime collaborator Wally Pfister, who shot every Nolan film from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Whether on Earth or in space, theres a haunted, shadowy, slightly off-center quality to Van Hoytemas frames, which conveys the highly relevant sense that some of the story is taking place off-screen, in realms or dimensions we dont see.
At this point its almost a reflex action in sci-fi cinema to refer back to Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey and Andrei Tarkovskys Solaris, those tragic-elegiac masterpieces of another age. I will leave it to dissertation authors of the future to figure out all the elements Nolan pilfers, reworks and recombines from those two films, but he is certainly playing a deeper game than random quotation. No doubt its too simplistic to say that Nolan is trying to push astronaut Dave Bowmans transcendental journey in 2001 toward a more satisfying (and comprehensible) outcome, or to figure out who, what and where the mysterious Starchild cosmic-embryo thingummy might be. But thats somewhere in the right analytical ballpark, as is the argument that hes trying to render the symbolic homecoming in Solaris into an event in physical reality, rather than an imprecise metaphor for God or art or Russia or the Eternal Something. Whether those movies required a conceptual mashup/remake aimed at a 21st century mass audience is a more difficult question.
Interstellar begins in an odd, slow mode of apocalyptic lamentation, as if it were ending before it had started. This could be a clue to the Nolans Mbius-strip narrative structure, as are the documentary-style snippets that seem to be about the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. (On second viewing, a lot of that material will yield new information.) But in fact the onetime ace test pilot and engineer called Coop (McConaughey) is living amid some near-future Dust Bowl America, when nothing but corn will grow anymore (and less and less of that), and renegade Indian Air Force drones fly overhead, long severed from their terrestrial commanders. Of course Nolan knows hes channeling all sorts of heartland-set farm-family movies, including Field of Dreams and Shyamalans Signs. But its highly unfortunate that the most recent, and strikingly similar, multiplex example is the Mark Wahlberg-led, robot-infested farmstead of Michael Bays Transformers: Age of Extinction.
While the mood of these early scenes is eloquent and elegant, you cant help wondering how the hell this lugubrious tale about a nation and a planet skidding into the ecological Dumpster will send its protagonist into outer space. With a bang and a zoom, thats how. Something or someone is sending the family messages by knocking books off the shelves and arranging dust on the floor; Coops daughter, Murph, played by Mackenzie Foy as a child and later by Chastain, says its a poltergeist. (Yes, this is a farm family where people are named Coop and Murph. No doubt Sarge, Bucky and Hawk are out in the fields.)
Without going into specifics, lets just say that Coop and Murph discover that NASA still exists, despite officially having been defunded and, oh yeah, they need Coop to fly a spaceship through a newly discovered wormhole out near Jupiter, and thence into a distant galaxy in search of viable planets, since ours is toast. (As a bumper sticker you used to see in the Pacific Northwest puts it: Earth First. Well log the other planets later.) Coop is a widower, long a Hollywood device to raise the pathos level and the hero's swoon-worthiness, but also a fact that ought to make it extra unlikely he will bail out on his kids. But before you have time to say ""What the hey?"" Coop takes his protein pills, puts his helmet on and blasts into the movies second chapter, leaving his family (including his teenage son, played by Timothe Chalamet and later by Casey Affleck, and his aging father-in-law, a pleasurably laconic John Lithgow) behind on a dying planet with only a microscopic possibility  given the unknown nature of his destination and what we know about relativity and high-speed space travel  that hell ever see them again.
McConaughey holds the screen beautifully, fixing his iconic mug on the boundary of fate whether hes driving an ancient Dodge pickup through Nebraskastan or piloting a deep-space probe toward mysterious planets a bit too close to a black holes event horizon. Obviously the space mission is what we came for, and thats the best stuff in Interstellar, intense, suspenseful and heartbreaking. Coop is accompanied to infinity and beyond by a persnickety scientist named Amelia Brand (Hathaway), who may have her own agenda, a pair of more disposable crew members played by Wes Bentley and David Gyasi, and a wisecracking robot named TARS, voiced by Bill Irwin, a completely idiotic and counter-logical idea that totally works. (In addition to those more serious movies I mentioned, theres just a little bit of the campy 60s TV series Lost in Space at work in Interstellar.)
As Coop and his crew travel from one mind-blowing otherworldly scenario to another, looking for bread crumb trails suggesting that previous voyagers have found a new home for the human race, theyre acutely aware that time is passing at a different rate back on Earth, and is literally running out. Even if Coop comes back alive, his kids are likely to be long dead of old age  and his grandkids are likely to suffocate in a poisoned atmosphere. Heres where we start getting to my litany of objections to Interstellar, which begin with the fact that every time Nolan encounters an enormous hole in storytelling logic  or scientific logic, or even theological logic, because there is such a thing  he blasts through it at light-speed, hoping well be dazzled into not noticing.
Nolan has said that he hopes the movie will encourage renewed public interest in space travel, which is now seen in most Western countries as an expensive and unnecessary luxury. I entirely support that goal; I think its a great historic mistake to hold science hostage to neoliberal economics, or to abandon it to autocratic regimes like Russia and China. But for all the philosophical nostrums and pop physics in Interstellar, Nolan waffles so much on the horrifying and ludicrous notion that we should abandon our planet and go find another one to rape that I honestly cant tell you where he comes down, or even exactly how the movie ends. (I would also argue that the Nolans have grossly and irritatingly misread Dylan Thomas' famous villanelle Do not go gentle into that good night, which is about the unquenchable, unavoidable tragedy of the death of one individual, and not at all about the human species. But thats become a pop-culture staple, and its pointless to complain.)
Then again, maybe the problem is that the Spielberg-Shyamalan mask of sentimental populism doesnt entirely fit, and that Nolan cant help playing a game of bait-and-switch with his audience. Interstellar is thrilling to watch across its moments but ultimately unmemorable; I feel it slipping away from me even now. Its an almost convincing simulation of a great mainstream movie made by an entity from another dimension, who sees our flaws with a mixture of amusement and dim, theoretical sympathy, but who finally doesnt care whether we save our planet or not, whether we live in reality or delusion, whether we rage against the dying of the light or suck the tailpipe of our self-constructed engine of doom and die.
",NHS_Doc8_Interstellar,NHS,Sci_Fi,Negative,Interstellar
208,NHS_Doc9_Interstellar,"Writer/director Christopher Nolan takes on literally cosmic issues with Interstellar. It is an ambitious, provocative, thoughtful, and highly entertaining film that deals with, well, pretty much everything, and, all things considered (believe me, ALL things are considered), it holds together very well.
Its the near future and some blight has turned humans from progressive, curious, and optimistic to beaten down, hopeless, close to desperate. We once looked up to the stars and dreamed, says Cooper (Matthew McConaughey). Now we look down to the dirt and worry. Cooper was once an engineer at NASA. Now, like most people left, he is a farmer, struggling to grow crops in a world that has turned into a dustbowl, with plant species dying off until all that is left is corn. Cooper is a widower with two children, teenaged Tom and 10-year-old Murphy, and they live with his father-in-law (John Lithgow). The earth is not all that has been blighted. It is a post-enlightenment society scrambling for caretaking, with no intellectual aspirations or opportunities. Coopers wife died because medical technology and expertise that was once available no longer exists. And he is called into school because Murphy is in trouble for insisting that Americans once landed on the moon. That never happened, Murphys teacher explains a little impatiently. That was just a clever ruse to bankrupt the Soviet Union. The clear implication is that this revisionist history is itself a clever ruse to prevent young people from developing an interest in science that human society no longer believes has any value when the only possibility of survival is to return to the cultural norms of a thousand years ago, when most of human endeavor was devoted to making food. We do not know why the idea that science might be of aid in solving the food production crisis is no longer of interest. A comment by one person that greed created problems may be a clue.
Murphy insists that she is getting messages from a ghost who throws books off the shelf in her bedroom. When Cooper investigates, it appears to be an anomaly of some kind, a gravitational singularity, a message. The ghosts message points to a location. When Cooper goes there, Murphy stows away in the car. It turns out to be a secret NASA facility led by Dr. Brand (Michael Caine). They have concluded that Earth can no longer sustain human life. They have sent out rocket probes to find an alternate planet that can sustain human life. Plan A is to be able to transport Earths inhabitants to a new location. The project is called Lazarus. Plan B, if no one alive can be saved, is to transport fertilized eggs to the new location and begin again, a new Genesis. They want Cooper to pilot the ship.
And this sets up the central conflict of the story. It is only secondarily about whether humans can, will, or should continue as a species and culture. The primary concern is the relationship between Cooper and Murphy. He wants more than anything in the world to stay with her and watch her grow up. But he knows his participation is critical to the mission  no one else going has ever actually flown before  and if the mission fails, Murphys generation will be the last. In a wrenching scene, Cooper has to leave while Murphy is furious and hurt. He promises he will come back. Parent-child relationships and especially promises broken and kept, echo throughout the storyline.
Dr. Brands daughter (Anne Hathaway) is on the crew and the trip into space leads to some mind-bending conversations about cosmology, including wormholes, black holes, and why an hour on one planet can translate into seven years for the occupants of the spaceship circulating above. The visual effects (all built or practical effects, no digital/green screen) are stunning.
The storyline also provides an opportunity for extremely complex and difficult moral choices, as the crew has to make decisions based on very limited information and even more limited time.  The broad sweep of themes means that some choices work better than others.  The ending seems rushed and not entirely thought through. Cutting back and forth between scenes in outer space and back on earth during one passage goes on too long, and one mention of Dylan Thomas famous poem would be plenty.  A detour involving an unbilled actor with an almost-unforgivably on-the-nose character name is particularly poorly conceived.  But even that scene is so visually striking that it barely registers as a diversion.  And overall, the films willingness to place the biggest questions in the grand sweep of the universe is absorbing and it is impossible not to be moved by it.
",NHS_Doc9_Interstellar,NHS,Sci_Fi,Positive,Interstellar
209,NHS_Doc10_Interstellar,"Christopher Nolan has never shied away from a challenge and the one he has taken on with Interstellar may be his most prodigious thus far - bigger than delivering an end-to-start chronology in Memento, more impressive than the mind-bending contortions of Inception, and more daunting than re-imagining Batman into the most unique superhero franchise of the 21st century. Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking. It's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it.

Interstellar is science fiction. It's not space opera. It's not futuristic fantasy. It's what the term ""science fiction"" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and uncertain. Starships aren't zipping from planet to planet. Space craft aren't firing lasers, phasers, or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and there's even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn't Star Wars, Star Trek, or Guardians of the Galaxy, and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. It's more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them.

It will be difficult to find a review of Interstellar that doesn't reference 2001: A Space Odyssey and there's a valid reason for that. Nolan at times uses Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece as a template, especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmer's score is no less crucial to Interstellar than ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" was to 2001. Yet, this is no mere copy of Kubrick's film; in fact, it goes far afield. There's heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It's also a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact, found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable: the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. It's almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg.

Interstellar opens at an unspecified future date in America's farm belt. Although the film is careful not to identify a year, it's probably around 2050. The world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. With nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. Former NASA engineer and test pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family: son Tom, daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Drawn by almost supernatural means to a chain-link fence around a super-secret location, Cooper finds himself face-to-face with what remains of his former employer: an underground think-tank dedicated to saving the human race. Led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), NASA has developed two plans. The first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. The second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. There are problems with Plan A - namely, overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship - but Brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible.

Cooper learns that a wormhole has appeared in space near Saturn, presumably placed there by (alien) entities of great intelligence intent upon giving humanity a path of survival. Ten years ago, astronauts were sent through to scout the dozen potentially habitable planets on the other side. Now another craft must make the journey to determine humankind's final destination. Mindful that his children's future is at stake, Cooper agrees to pilot the craft. He is accompanied by a small crew of four: Brand's daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway); scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the sardonic robot TARS (Bill Irwin), who recalls HAL 9000. Murph is resentful of her father for abandoning her - an anger she nurses into adulthood, when (now played by Jessica Chastain), she becomes Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her.

Like Contact, Interstellar displays an uncanny knack for making complex physics accessible to laymen (partial credit to Executive Producer and CalTech physicist Kip Thorne). Yes, there are times when the dialogue is dense but it never becomes impenetrable (although there are some odd passages, such as one in which Cooper and Amelia discuss the meaning of ""love""). Does the movie occasionally fudge? Of course, but it sticks closer to Einstein's laws than most space-faring movies and when it speculates, it does so in a believable manner.

The movie remains Earthbound for its first 45 minutes, establishing a dire scenario for the planet and depicting the day-to-day struggles of those who survive in this blasted, inhospitable future. Most importantly, however, this part of the film establishes the closeness of the relationship between Cooper and Murph and introduces the mystery of ""them"" - the mysterious ""ghosts"" who will play a part on the periphery for the rest of the movie. In the end, Cooper must embrace the philosophy that ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" He promises to Murph that he will return, knowing he may not be able to keep that promise.

Once in space, the white knuckle moments begin. Limiting the use of CGI, Nolan relies on practical effects to craft a movie that feels more like a real journey than a video game. There are some tremendous action set pieces and the narrative is wonderfully unpredictable. The movie takes some chances with its endgame, which resolves a lot of plot points but at times seems rushed. Interstellar is at its most complex during its final 20 minutes and even those who pay rapt attention may leave the theater with some unanswered questions.

The film is nearly three hours but there's enough story here for something a lot longer. In condensing it, Nolan has made something 169 minutes in length that breezes by faster than many productions half its length. He accomplishes this by establishing a blistering pace during Interstellar's meatier sections, including expert cross-cutting between Earth and space during a powerful ""fire and ice"" sequence.

Visually, Interstellar looks great. Nolan understands all the facets of special effects technology (except, perhaps, old age makeup) and uses them to their best. Hans Zimmer delivers an operatic score that, although occasionally drowning out dialogue (more a mixing issue than a scoring one), adds to the overall experience. Sound is important to Interstellar - when the rocket lifts off around the 45-minute mark, the bass shakes the entire theater.

It has been a tremendous year for McConaughey. From Dallas Buyers Club to True Detective to Interstellar, he has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar and been nominated for an Emmy. Interstellar will give him another opportunity for Academy recognition: he's the glue that holds everything together. He's the human factor in a vast universe. His love for his daughter and his pain when he acknowledges her despair invests this movie with a warmth and feeling that no previous Nolan movie can boast. The supporting cast, which includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, is strong, but McConaughey represents the heart and soul of Interstellar.

For those who appreciate the Mobius strip approach Nolan is known for, Interstellar offers a little of that. There are some twists and non-chronological jumps, although not so many that the story becomes confusing or unintelligible. Time dilation (the slowing down of time for those in close proximity to a dense gravitational source) isn't just a convenient plot device; it's an integral element of the narrative. Like nearly everything else in Interstellar, it is used effectively.

For anyone with a hunger for real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers (and that I often enjoy immensely), Interstellar is a satisfying entre. I'd rank this alongside Memento and The Dark Knight as the best Nolan has done, and it's an immediate contender for one of 2014's best. The film deserves the label of an ""experience"" and the bigger the venue, the more immersive it will be. As event movies go, this is one of the most unique and mesmerizing.",NHS_Doc10_Interstellar,NHS,Sci_Fi,Positive,Interstellar
210,RUS_Doc1_TheMartian,"The Martian isn't the first trip to space for Ridley Scott, the director perhaps best known for his 1979 breakout film Alien. But unlike the harrowing story of E. Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) and their unwelcome extraterrestrial guest in the acclaimed horror sci-fi, Scott's newest space film—despite some scratches, a brush with death, and one grueling skin-stapling scene—reads like a feel-good flick. It's the kind of fun summer blockbuster popcorn fare usually saved for vacation months. Not that The Martian isn't a smart movie. Quite the contrary, actually—despite being marketed under the mainstream bait of a ""space movie,"" The Martian (based on Andy Weir's novel) is, more than anything, a love letter to science, without ever feeling like a boring textbook.
""I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this,"" Matt Damon's character Mark Watney says, delivering his most memorable line with equal parts despair and hilarity. It's one of those so-dire-all-you-can-do-is-laugh type of situations—being alone on Mars with no means of getting back home. And as promised, he does really science the shit out of his situation. 
Damon, Hollywood's It Boy-turned-Problematic Celeb, plays the perfect sassy astronaut (sasstronaut?) as Watney, who, after being presumed dead during a mission gone wrong on Mars, is abandoned by his crew mates (played by the always wonderful Jessica Chastain as the Captain, with Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, and Aksel Hennie). By wonderful coincidence, Watney happens to be the team's botanist, which means if anyone is going to know how to harvest and survive on the foreign planet, it's going to be him. (And yes, that newfound water on Mars has served as amazing publicity.)
What keeps The Martian from becoming a sad, existential lone man film is that Watney does everything with a good dose of humor, sometimes stooping low for the cheap thrills (like gathering his crew mates' shit—literally—for fertility) and other times using the droll humor of a man who may end up dying alone, on Mars of all places. It's like his comedy—much of which he captures on a video diary for record-keeping—is equally a necessity for science and history, as it is a vehicle for self-entertainment. After all, there's not much to keep him entertained out there, other than his captain's disco records, which he begrudgingly puts on and then makes a point to bash any chance he gets. (Ironically, these disco tracks make up a big chunk of the film's fire soundtrack.)
It's in large part to Damon's performance and Drew Goddard's script that, despite the nightmarish premise of being stranded alone on unknown, possibly hostile, territory, The Martian always leans more towards comic than serious. The initial comparisons to Gravity and Interstellar (weirdly, another space movie starring Damon and Chastain) will feel as distant as Mars itself. It's so fun that even science—science!—becomes an enjoyable topic. It doesn't hurt that a manic pixie just-got-out-of-bed Donald Glover does the crazy mathematics, figuring out the most efficient way to save Watney. (Glover's appearance in the film is as unnecessary as it is entertaining.) The plot is as straightforward as it gets—""bring him home,"" as the tagline reads—but the actual calculations, and the calculated comedy that go into his survival will tug at the hearts of every inner nerd. (And if the botanical or mathematical parts don't do it for you, maybe the casual Lord of the Rings reference made in front of Sean Bean will.) 
The Martian is a fun ode to nerds, and thanks to the magic of Hollywood, you get to ogle at astronauts who look like Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain (the stuff of dreams—or, rather, movie make-believe). It also comes neatly packaged in a Hollywood happily-ever-after—a triumph after a near-impossible mission and an inspirational montage in between (this one, appropriately, set to David Bowie's ""Starman""). At over two hours long—keeping in tradition with epic-long space films—The Martian never feels toiling. Instead, you'll leave the theater wanting to go home and science the shit out of something.",RUS_Doc1_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Positive,The Martian
211,RUS_Doc2_TheMartian,"Poor Matt Damon. Nobody wants to be friends with him. Last year, in “Interstellar,” he played an astronaut named Mann, who was sent through a wormhole and ended up alone, on a frozen planet. This year, in “The Martian,” he plays an astronaut named Mark Watney, who is marooned in a pelting storm and left behind, alone, on the red planet. The difference is that Mann was cunning and resentful, prepared to cause havoc in his desperation to escape, whereas Watney is cunning and resourceful—not a blamer, or a soul in meltdown, but a model of cockiness and grit as he sets about the business of survival.

Watney is part of Ares III, a NASA mission to Mars, captained by the phlegmatic Lewis (Jessica Chastain), who floats around her ship like a zero-gravity mermaid. The rest of the crew comprises Martinez (Michael Peña), Johanssen (Kate Mara), Vogel (Aksel Hennie), and Beck (Sebastian Stan). Having landed on the planet, and settled into base camp, they last eighteen days before the storm blows in and forces them to abort, blasting off at a perilous angle. Watney is abandoned, presumed dead. All this happens fast, at the outset of the movie—so fast, indeed, that it’s the only section that feels rushed. We scarcely have a chance to get our bearings before they are thrown out of whack, and we see very little of Watney before he wakes up in the desert, on a nice bright Martian day, with a length of broken radar antenna sticking out of his gut. No matter. From here on, we have all the time in the world. And he has four years to kill, on his world, before anyone can swing by to pick him up.

But how do you dramatize a waiting game? Given the threat of tedium, and the stony desolation of the backdrop, some viewers will be bracing themselves for Beckett in space, with the added twist that Godot could burn up on reëntry. Do not fret. The director is Ridley Scott, who, as if taking a cue from his hero, rejoices in the challenge of solitude. He cuts between the cameras mounted inside the base, which show Watney toiling away (plus, in a worrying side panel, the pressure, temperature, and oxygen levels). There is also a video diary, to which Watney confides his schemes and ruminations, all of which scorn the existential in favor of the pragmatic. He is the mission botanist, ideally placed to raise crops with which to feed himself. “Mars will come to fear my botany powers,” he declares, before gathering the dried excrement of his colleagues. Plug your nostrils, add soil, sow seeds, hang around, and—hey presto—potatoes. If there is water on Mars, nobody told Watney, so he has to brew his own. In short, when he announced, early in his predicament, “I’m going to have to science the shit out of this,” he wasn’t kidding.

Ridley Scott is seventy-seven years old, yet the startling fact is that “The Martian” appears to be the work of a young man. When Watney, having made contact with Earth, states that he is “really looking forward to not dying,” he speaks for the whole production, which thrums with an appetite for life. It can’t get enough of the right stuff. There are plenty of scenes back at NASA, where the bigwigs—played by good-humored actors like Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Kristen Wiig—struggle to keep up with Watney’s progress, and where even a simple press conference is framed and edited to keep the tone sprightly and deft. Much of Scott’s output in the past decade, from “Kingdom of Heaven” (2005) to “Exodus: Gods and Kings” (2014), resounded with a heavy tread, whereas the new film, based on a novel by Andy Weir, is so light on its feet that anybody listening at the door of the theatre might think that there was a comedy playing inside. Again and again, chances for portentousness arise and get batted aside. When the folks on Ares III, still journeying home, learn that their friend is alive, and that lines of communication are open, Martinez sends him an e-mail: “Sorry we left you on Mars, but we just don’t like you.” He knows that Watney will get a kick out of that, and behind the joshing is the unspoken promise that, come what may, the crew will move heaven and earth to get him back.

It is thirty-six years since Scott made “Alien,” and the true companion piece to that great film is not “Prometheus”—the gloomy, beautiful, and oddly superfluous prequel that he directed in 2012—but “The Martian.” Sigourney Weaver and Matt Damon are cut from similar cloth. True, the first is faced by a beast with acid for blood, while the second solemnly reveals that “it has been seven days since I ran out of ketchup,” but both are loners by force of circumstance and copers by instinct. In a recent interview, Scott described “Robinson Crusoe” as “one of my favorite books as a kid” and its hero as “the first astronaut,” and the new film tunes in to that old fixation. So does its leading man. Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift. Would any other actor have shouldered the weight of the role with such diligent grace? He is our most unstarry star, no longer needing to hunt for our good will. Someone like Tom Cruise is too acutely conscious of his image to convince as a regular Joe, and Christian Bale too remote, whereas Damon, like Crusoe, feels stranded on our behalf, tasked with digging up the best of himself. Hence the first, grainy picture of Watney that is patched through to NASA; he may be Lazarus, come from the dead, but he poses in his spacesuit, thumbs way up, as the Fonz. Terrible place, Mars. Happy days.

If you think Mark Watney is in a tight spot, look at Jafar Panahi. He is the Iranian director whose works include “The White Balloon” (1995), “The Circle” (2000), and “Offside” (2006). With every film, three things have occurred: he has strengthened his reputation as a wry and dexterous humanist; he has urged us to listen to those Iranians, especially women and children, whose voices might not otherwise be heard; and his overlords have grown ever more convinced that this guy is a pain in the neck. The crunch came in 2010, when Panahi was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment, on a charge of creating propaganda against the regime, and banned from making movies for twenty years. Since then, he has occupied himself with projects designed to exasperate his foes. One result was a film with the Magrittean title of “This Is Not a Film” (2011), which was reportedly smuggled out on a flash drive concealed in a cake. If only all releases could be handled in so thrilling a fashion. Imagine if the new James Bond movie could arrive inside a chocolate éclair.

Panahi’s latest exercise in outwitting is “Taxi,” in which he plays himself. He spends almost the entire film behind the wheel of a cab, which he drives around Tehran. It’s never quite clear if he has slid under the radar of the authorities, or if they consider life in a car to be a kind of mobile incarceration, which at least will keep him out of mischief. Nice try, fellows. His conversations are filmed by a dashboard camera, which he occasionally swivels around to inspect the road ahead or to record the activity of his passengers, one or two at a time. “What’s that?” he is asked. “An anti-theft device?” “Sort of,” Panahi replies, and he’s right. Simply by catching these lives on the fly, he offers a fresh rebuke to the embezzlement of his free speech.

The people in his taxi are a mixed bunch. Are they actors, or passersby plucked from the streets? We don’t know, and there are no end credits, but the mystery is sweet. We get a loudmouth who, discussing thieves, announces, “If I were head of state, I’d hang a couple of them, just to shake them up,” then adds that he’s a mugger by trade. There’s a victim of an accident, his head wet with blood, who gets ferried to hospital; a couple of elderly ladies bearing an open goldfish bowl, sloshing with water, as if lent to Panahi by the ghost of Mack Sennett; and a man named Omid—stumpy and sweaty, delivering foreign DVDs around town like drugs. (“I brought you ‘The Walking Dead,’ Season Five.”) Then comes Panahi’s niece Hana, a chatterbox of ten or eleven, and Arash, an acquaintance from his neighborhood. Finally, we meet “the flower lady,” as Hana calls her, a human-rights lawyer en route to a client in jail. She lays a red rose next to the windshield, as if by the headstone of a grave.

The urge to film is never far away. The wounded man dictates his last will and testament into Panahi’s iPhone; Arash has CCTV footage on his iPad, showing him being mugged, which he wants to share with Panahi; and, as for Hana, she has to shoot a short movie for school, under risible restrictions. (For good characters, pupils must “use the sacred names of Islamic saints.”) All this could have yielded something clammy and cloistered, just as Panahi’s status as a martyr for his art could have gulled him into loftiness and pride; and yet, by some miracle, “Taxi” stays as modest as his smile, the point being not to recruit us to his cause but to put us on the side of his compatriots. The mocking of oppression may be steely, but the film’s an easy ride.",RUS_Doc2_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Positive,The Martian
212,RUS_Doc3_TheMartian,"Let’s get one thing straight, right off the bat: you can’t judge an actor’s work by the stupid shit they say off-screen. We’ve said it before, but it bears repeating; you’re not just inviting unnecessary peripherals into your viewing experience, but you may very well end up missing some fine films for no good reason. That said, the ill-timed PR crash-and-burn campaign currently befalling Matt Damon is particularly unfortunate, and not only because he seemed like such a reasonable and thoughtful guy, before he started white-splaining diversity and advising gay actors to closet it up. It’s tough because the success of the movie he’s ostensibly promoting, Ridley Scott’s adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel The Martian, rests so fully on our engagement with, and admiration of, the actor.

He plays Mark Watney, left behind during a manned mission to Mars that goes awry, his commander (Jessica Chastain) and crew assuming he’s dead. But he’s not; he wakes up disoriented, inured, and basically out of oxygen. After dragging himself to their base and performing a bit of sweaty self-surgery, he survives — though the duration of that survival is up for grabs. Even if he can establish contact, it’ll take four years to get another crew up there, far less than the oxygen and food on hand. “So, yeah,” he says. “Yeah.” And that seems to be that; he casually sits down to watch his life tick away, before the turnaround comes. “I’m not gonna die up here,” he decides. There’s one way to stay alive: “I’m gonna have to science the shit outta this.”

In the wrong hands, a line like that — and, frankly, a movie like this — could sink like a stone. So the casting of Damon in this role is key, not only because he’s credibly smart enough to play a botanist/astronaut/MacGyver in space, but because usually, his neighborhood-guy likability puts you on his side. You’re up there with him, and hopefully pulling for him, not unlike Tom Hanks on the desert island in Cast Away. And Damon doesn’t need a volleyball, as the film wisely has Watney keep filing video logs of the mission, ostensibly to document it but presumably to give himself “someone” to talk to. So there’s your exposition and explanation; it also allows welcome shots of humor, via dialogue like, “I don’t mean to sound arrogant, but I am the greatest botanist on this planet.”

For much of the first act, The Martian seems to follow the mold of the Zemeckis film — and then it begins to break away. For reasons frankly never quite explained to my satisfaction, communication with NASA isn’t possible, until a satellite watcher takes note of unexplained movements on the red planet. And thus the space organization must pull an “eh, not so much” following a public tragedy and state funeral, and figure out how to get this guy home.

And it takes some figuring. Your mileage may vary, but this viewer gets a particular charge out of fiction preoccupied with the very simple task of dramatizing people doing their jobs who are particularly good at them. Scott assembles an enviable supporting cast — Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Mackenzie Davis, Kristen Wiig, and Donald Glover on the ground; Chastain, Kate Mara, Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan, and Aksel Hennie in the air — all of them playing very smart people who will work on the problem and, hell or high water, will solve it.

They perform calculations. They create mirror sites, replicate his actions, try out possible hacks. They adjust timelines, and readjust them. Colleagues volunteer, at great risk. And when all else fails, they improvise. (I have no idea if the science here checks out, and I could not care less, “fact-checking” web articles; what matters, since we’re talking about a motion picture, is I believe it checks out.) There are setbacks and defeats; each hurt more than if he’d just thrown in the towel at beginning, because now, survival seems possible. Frankly, when you’ve got Chiwetel Ejiofor on your side, anything seems possible.

And that spirit is ultimately what carries The Martian, past the questionable narrative stumbles, the peculiar techniques (not sure about those fast-forwards, Ridley), and the unfortunate ‘70s pop soundtrack that feels like someone trying to be clever, which is never a good look (I’ve been assured that this ill-advised, one-joke gimmick was present in the novel, but space montage sequences with a disco beat nevertheless feel like they’re ripping off Guardians of the Galaxy). It’s just a cracklingly good entertainment, a crowd-pleaser that’s compelling and emotional and even a little inspirational.

There will come a time in almost any mission, Watney tells the students in his astronaut training course, when you think you might die. You can train for it, and you can think you’re ready for it, but when that moment comes, it’s devastating — to come to terms with the fact that this is it. “Now, you can either accept that,” he tells them, “or you can get to work.” The equation lies at the heart of The Martian; it’s what the movie’s really about, beyond an astronaut stuck on Mars. The spirit of “getting to work” is what propels the movie, and gives it its charge. This is a movie about smart people facing problems that are seemingly out of their reach, and rising to the occasion. Here’s hoping Damon can do the same.

The Martian is out Friday.",RUS_Doc3_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Positive,The Martian
213,RUS_Doc4_TheMartian,"Of all the people to get stranded on Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is the lucky one. Smart, resourceful, cunning, and, most importantly, optimistic, Watney can grow potatoes using human feces, manufacture water simply and reconfigure every possible piece of technology available to him. All while maintaining hope in the face of certain catastrophe and sanity in spite of being the only living soul on a planet. Yes, indeed, Mark Watney is one of those rare breeds.

The Martian is a shipwreck story located in the barren wasteland of Mars, set to swinging ’70s disco music and featuring a diverse cast of incredibly smart people doing extraordinarily smart things. The Martian is a sci-fi movie heavy on science but even heavier on the abilities of the human mind to work through any situation presents.

And the science of The Martian seems sound. Or, it is at least presented as such. Thought dead and left on the planet by his crew, Watney must devise a way to create a sustainable food source and contact NASA in hopes of staying alive long enough for a rescue mission to be dispatched. Back in Huston, NASA—headed by Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels)—works with the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena—headed by Bruce Ng (Benedict Wong)—to do the right thing and bring their boy home, regardless of cost, which is astronomical, and man-hours necessary, which is all.

Movies operate primarily with a show don’t tell rule, but The Martian has a lot to tell and manages it with grace and humor. With no one else to talk to, Watney records conversational video diaries of his trials, tribulations, and triumphs on Mars. He lines out his problems, explains how he plans to resolve them, and then reports on their successes or failures. When they succeed, he conveys the perfect amount of American swagger and male triumph—he is genuinely proud and surprised with himself—but when they fail, he is humble and honest. In both cases, Watney’s humor is what keeps The Martian buoyant.

And this buoyancy becomes the most fascinating aspects of The Martian and the most fictitious. Much time is spent with Watney and his acceptance of this situation, which ultimately results in a sublime understanding of existence, but little time is spent with Watney grappling with the issues of imminent mortality and crushing loneliness. Instead, Watney plays the archetypal American go-getter who can think his way out of a problem, or as he puts it, “Science the shit out of this.” This attitude extends far beyond Watney. His crew members—who willingly give up an extra two years of their lives to rescue him—all have families who play second fiddle to the mission, which says nothing of the employees of NASA and JPL, who literally work around the clock for 500+ days and spend an enormous amount of time and money to bring Watney home.

But that’s not what The Martian is about by a long shot. Based on the novel by Andy Weir and adapted by Drew Goddard, The Martian celebrates the brilliant minds and resources across the globe that must come together to conquer mankind’s final frontier. What Watney shows, with a great deal of humor, is that the spirit of the adventurer has not withered and died. They have just been waiting in the wings for their time to come. If the geeks don’t inherit the Earth, they certainly will inherit the future.",RUS_Doc4_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Positive,The Martian
215,RUS_Doc6_TheMartian,"Veteran director Ridley Scott’s science fiction film The Martian is based on the 2011 novel by American author Andy Weir. In the movie’s opening scene the crew of the Ares III manned mission to Mars is forced to abandon their plans and leave the planet when a severe, hurricane-like sandstorm descends on them. Unavoidably left behind is crew member Mark Watney (Matt Damon), presumed to be dead after being struck by communications equipment and separated from the others during the storm.
Matt Damon in The Martian

Watney, in fact, survives the disaster and is able to treat his injuries. He finds the living and working quarters the crew had set up (“the Hab”) intact and has enough food for several hundred Martian days, or sols (each sol is some 24 hours, 40 minutes). However, he is alone on the desolate planet, tens of millions of kilometers from home. Watney has no means of communicating with Earth, because of the destruction of the communication gear in the tempest, and the next manned mission is not scheduled for another four years. How can he survive that long and how can he travel to the location of that mission’s landing, some 3,200 kilometers away?

A botanist (and a mechanical engineer, at least in the Weir novel), Watney sets about solving his various problems. He grows potatoes inside the habitat’s artificial environment and begins to modify his only vehicle, a rover, to make possible much longer trips.

Meanwhile, on Earth, satellite photos of Mars make clear to NASA engineers in Houston, Texas that Watney is alive and moving around. NASA director Terry Sanders (Jeff Daniels) orders his staff not to inform the surviving members of the Ares mission, now on board the Hermes spacecraft heading home, that Watney is alive, for fear of distracting them. Watney cleverly locates and digs up the Pathfinder probe, inactive since 1997 and uses it to begin communicating with NASA.

NASA officials and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California debate various plans for rescuing the stranded astronaut. They agree to send a probe to Mars to resupply Watney so he can last another several years on the planet. In their efforts to speed up the process, however, they take shortcuts that result in disaster. Watney experiences his own disaster on Mars, which wipes out his potato crop.
Kristen Wiig and Chiwetel Ejiofor

Now what? The Chinese space program then enters the picture, as does a young, brilliant astrodynamicist. The Ares III crew itself has a life-and-death decision to make …

Although The Martian grows tedious from time to time in the course of its two hours and 20 minutes, its central motif—the massive effort, which is eventually followed by masses of people all over the globe, to save one man—is a humane and intriguing one. A large number of people cooperate, and not in pursuit of money or celebrity, to save a single life.

In his novel, Weir writes: “If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it’s found in every culture without exception.”

It is moving when the film reaches its denouement and Watney’s fate, along with the fate of the rest of the Ares III crew, is decided. One certainly feels for his situation and emphatically hopes for his safe return.

As opposed to Gravity (Alfonso Cuarón), with its quasi-religious imagery, and Interstellar (Christopher Nolan), with its murky dystopianism, The Martian (aside from one brief flirtation with a crucifix) aspires to be an eminently practical film, with its paean to “Yankee ingenuity” and stick-to-itiveness. Having decided that “I am not going to die on this planet,” Watney sets out his various tasks and performs them, one by one.
Jessica Chastain

The scientific-technical challenges and solutions are interesting, occasionally fascinating: Watney’s agricultural experiments, his discovery of a method to create water, his transformation of his rover vehicle, his retrieval of the Pathfinder probe and his re-establishing of communication with Earth, NASA’s various rescue plans, the final effort to intercept him in space. (The decision to paint the Chinese space program and officials in a positive light, given current US government policies, has to be considered almost an act of bravery.)

Unfortunately, when the film goes beyond the limits of depicting those practical tasks, it falters badly. One of the considerable difficulties The Martian faces is its literary-intellectual source. Weir, the son of an accelerator physicist and an electrical engineer, is a capable organizer-summarizer of materials and problems, and apparently knows his science (according to various publications), but he is not an artistically gifted writer.

Much of the novel consists of descriptions of various physical and chemical processes and Watney’s interventions in those processes, a sort of “How-to” manual for surviving in an enormously hostile environment, interspersed with essentially puerile monologues (Watney’s) or dialogue. The labored “jokiness” is particularly grating.

A few examples:

“Problem is (follow me closely here, the science is pretty complicated), if I cut a hole in the Hab, the air won’t stay inside anymore.”

“I tested the brackets by hitting them with rocks. This kind of sophistication is what we interplanetary scientists are known for.”

“But in the end, if everything goes to plan, I’ll have 92 square meters of crop-able soil. Hell yeah I’m a botanist! Fear my botany powers!”

“Back on Earth, universities and governments are willing to pay millions to get their hands on Mars rocks. I’m using them as ballast.”

This sort of wittiness, which is genuinely amusing one-tenth of the time, goes on ad infinitum. Along with references to disco music, Star Wars, Iron Man, The Dukes of Hazzard and Three’s Company. Reading the novel is too much like spending a number of hours with a precocious and especially self-approving undergraduate science student who aspires to be a stand-up comic.

It is hard to believe that any human being could go through the terrifying and life-altering experiences Weir describes and remain so unrelentingly shallow. The various astronauts and cosmonauts to date may not have always been the most articulate or cultured individuals, but one has the impression that they responded with considerable seriousness to the immensity of space and the significance of their own activities.
Jeff Daniels

Why the heavy-handed humor in the original novel? Perhaps Weir felt that only through such an approach could he “make the medicine go down,” i.e., render palatable to the public a complex story about the science of space travel and space survival. If that is the case, then he underestimated his audience.

Perhaps more to the point, the contrast between the remarkable scientific achievements, on the one hand, and the unserious depiction of the human interactions, on the other, speaks to an American malaise at present: technological abundance combined with a terrible cultural and intellectual deficiency.

Although Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard, to their credit, have dropped a good deal of the juvenilia and their work has a generally more sober tone than the novel, a portion of the book’s flippancy makes its way into the film too (including at certain critical moments!). Fortunately for the filmmakers, Matt Damon is appealing enough to render some of the silliness unobjectionable.

The screenplay, unhappily, has retained the general flatness of the scenes on Earth, or added its own. Scott has a number of talented performers at his disposal, who struggle to make something of the oddly colorless and often drama-less dialogue and sequences, including Daniels as the NASA chief, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean as NASA mission directors and Kristen Wiig as the agency’s spokesperson. Wiig has almost nothing to do, except occasionally shoot a quizzical or bemused glance at one character or another, in a seeming reference to the comic films she is normally in, but which has nothing to do with The Martian.

In two small parts, Mackenzie Davis (as a satellite planner in NASA’s Mission Control Center) and Donald Glover (as the NASA astrodynamicist) are least touched by the “canned,” bureaucratic character of the NASA-JPL scenes.

Scott has now been making feature films long enough, since the late 1970s, that he is referred to in some quarters as a great director. Such a characterization confuses artistic greatness with canniness and box office success. Scott’s films are essentially products of the Hollywood blockbuster era that began in 1975, albeit seasoned with a somewhat “outsider” (British), quasi-artistic sensibility. Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, Hannibal, American Gangster and The Counselor are distinguished by their “dark” and “edgy” visual flair, and often excessive brutality, but not by any important thematic confrontation with contemporary life.

In any event, Scott’s new film portrays a manned mission to Mars some time in the not too distant future. Science fiction indeed! No critic or anyone involved in the production has referred to the fact that the US shut down its manned space effort in 2011 for an indefinite period of time, thanks in large part to budget cuts, an event, as the WSWS noted at the time, of “considerable historical significance.”

Shortly after coming to office, the Obama administration cancelled a project that envisioned a return to the Moon by 2020, followed by a Mars mission using the Moon as a jumping-off point. The WSWS commented that the administration “proposed a manned mission to the asteroid belt by 2025, followed by a Mars flight, but pushed out so far into the future that it amounted to the tacit abandonment of any serious effort at manned space flight.”

The Christian Science Monitor, in July 2014, asked: “Will the US ever have [a] manned space program again?” The article noted that with its Space Launch System, a rocket system designed for launches into deep space, “NASA hopes to take a giant leap into deep space, but the US Government Accountability Office says that the space agency may not have enough money. According to a GAO estimate released Wednesday, NASA may be $400 million short to complete the project.” Billions and billions for the destruction of peoples and societies around the world, but not hundreds of millions for the exploration of space.",RUS_Doc6_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Negative,The Martian
216,RUS_Doc7_TheMartian,"We love stories of survival against all odds. Like a boy trapped in a well or the Chilean miners imprisoned in the bowels of the earth, there is something transcendent about the persistence of the human spirit in situations of grave peril. It unites us, breaks down partisan politics and ideological divides. In 1970, the country watched riveted as the lives of the men piloting Apollo 13 hung in the balance as NASA tried to bring the craft home. Ron Howard went on to direct a successful adaptation of the fateful mission, a ripped from the headlines tale that featured Tom Hanks recreating the perilous few days where it looked like astronaut James A. Lovell and his crew might not make it back to Earth alive.

In this vein, Ridley Scott’s adaptation of The Martian, Andy Weir’s 2011 novel, already has a successful pedigree as the director tells the story of an astronaut stranded on the red planet and the men and women who work to bring him back. As Mark Watney (Matt Damon) relies on ingenuity to keep himself alive despite lacking in food and oxygen, the folks at NASA also must figure out how to get him off Mars. This is an old fashioned survival tale gussied up with some cool special effects. But The Martian lacks the gut-punch excitement of Gravity (though boasting a much better script) and the ambition and awe of Interstellar, leaving the film in serviceable limbo where it could have really soared.

Adapted by Drew Goddard, The Martian doesn’t take itself as seriously as Apollo 13. Comic moments pepper the film, including Watney’s own self-aware video diary that he keeps in case he is never rescued. This is some pretty heavy shit, but Goddard lightens the despair with a punchy script that allows Damon to fall back on his charms as the stranded astronaut. It makes sense, especially since his actual chances of survival are quite slim. How miserable would it have been to spend two hours with a character lamenting his fate as he slowly runs out of sustenance and other materials?

But that glibness also detracts from emotionality, giving the entire film a glossy, dejected air that only gives perfunctory credence to the plight and feelings of its characters. Also, Goddard spends a lot of time concentrating on the science that both Watney and NASA use in their respective survival and rescue attempts. This is just fine, but he also inadvertently alienates audience members by both relying too much on hard science and then dumbing it down to appeal to wider audience. So who wins in this sort of situation? No one. Living on Mars or in a space craft has its struggles, but we’re too distracted by the conventionalities of the script to really experience the struggle.

Being rooted in reality does have its benefits. There are no aliens here, and all the peril is possible in outer space as we know it. Scott hasn’t made a good film in years and by being merely solid, The Martian may well be his best in a long time. Damon also does well as Watney, but the role really isn’t a stretch for him. The film is padded with a bevy of recognizable faces, from Jeff Daniels as the grimly embattled head of NASA to Jessica Chastain as Watney’s mission commander. Only Kristen Wiig feels horribly miscast as some NASA suit whose job description is nebulous.

For a film that’s set on Mars, The Martian is fairly pedestrian. Visiting a neighboring planet should be exciting, but things often toe a flat line. Watney may be taking a bunch of giant steps for mankind, but The Martian merely tiptoes around other great films that take on a similar topic.",RUS_Doc7_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Negative,The Martian
217,RUS_Doc8_TheMartian,"Matt Damon has lately spent so much onscreen time in space that one begins to worry about how he’ll reacclimatize to earthbound roles. He dodged flamboyant explosions to infiltrate a posh space station in Neill Blomkamp’s 2013 Elysium, and last year (in an uncredited maxi-cameo) harbored a confusing hidden agenda as the only inhabitant of an uninhabitable planet in Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. His latest movie, The Martian, strands him on the more accessible but no less unfriendly intra-galaxy terrain of the Red Planet, his fellow crew having up and left, presuming him dead after his bio-monitor goes kaput during a sandstorm. This plucky ensemble action movie, the moral of which is that you’re in trouble if you’re not troubleshooting, comes courtesy of perennial studio trustee Ridley Scott, himself not far removed from the Alien quasi-prequel Prometheus, a space opera that was bathed in a beautiful blue celestial light, and afflicted with an absolutely jaw-dropping attention deficit. (Sequels to the prequel in the pipe.)

Adapted from Andy Weir’s novel by Cabin in the Woods writer-director Drew Goddard, The Martian is an appreciably more involving and resourceful film than Prometheus—for a time it’s fun to watch Damon’s character, enthusiastically wise-cracking botanist Mark Watney, “science the shit” out of a host of problems, creating water out of a combustible chemistry-lab setup, deriving vital warmth from decaying plutonium, and so on. The tone, however, soon grows annoyingly flip, as the near-future sci-fi conjures up the recent past. Rather than any more enduring examples of the genre, The Martian perhaps most closely resembles the heedless pyrotechnics of the Bruckheimer back catalogue—particularly Michael Bay’s 1998 Armageddon, with its NASA cheerleading and proudly dumb (and entirely unmodulated) comic relief. Watney’s running commentary on the awfulness of disco—the only music he has access to, a cache of instantly recognizable hit singles having been left behind by mission commander Jessica Chastain—has to be one of the most beat-to-death jokes in recent cinema. In a suite of scenes that mostly serve to take this otherwise efficient movie off course, Donald Glover appears as an (ostensibly lovably hapless) on-the-spectrum astrophysicist, rubbing his superiors—and any viewers wary of such deep-dish clichés—the wrong way.

NASA—fronted here by Jeff Daniels, whose war room also hosts Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wiig, and Sean Bean—eventually catches on that Watney’s still alive, and Scott does instill a sense of urgency to the constant timetable revising that ensues once the parties establish contact: how soon can a rescue mission blast off, and how long can Watney subsist on his Turin Horse ration of boiled potatoes? As pure numbers-game suspense, the movie passes inspection, but the relative absence of soul searching, particularly by the protagonist, makes it seem a specious vehicle for the trumpeting of such human (well, substantially American) values as cooperation, perseverance, and self-sacrifice. The story depends on long-shot odds, but nothing here actually feels hard-won. Watney does break down a few times in end-of-the-road frustration, but the height of solitude doesn’t otherwise seem to faze him much—there’s not much desperation to his survive-at-all-costs determination. Mostly he’s content to deliver upbeat TV-host-style explanations of his spacehacks—pretty clever, he has to admit—into his home base’s video log, the content of which would take so long to transmit to Earth that he treats the camera like a companion, if not a confessor. In space, no one can hear you humblebrag. You can feel free to be a little bit insufferable.",RUS_Doc8_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Negative,The Martian
218,RUS_Doc9_TheMartian,"Is there life on Mars? Perhaps, but what we do know is that there’s certainly water.

No Hollywood studio in the world could choreograph a publicity stunt quite like it: on the opening week of The Martian, NASA discovers that there is indeed life-giving water on Mars. High fives all round, and the marketing department can take a well-deserved break.

But to be fair, The Martian sorely needed a publicity boost like this; without it, the film was careening its way towards a much sorrier fate.

The story goes as follows: after being left for dead on Mars by his comrades after a mission goes a bit awry, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself living on Mars, alone and with a finite supply of food.

As luck would have it, Watney is a botanist, and as he reminds himself and us after growing a crop of potatoes on the hostile Martian terrain, the finest botanist on the planet.

Meanwhile, the boffins down at NASA’s headquarters in Texas — and by god, are they boffins — have realised the crews’ mistake, and are on a mission to save their guy.

The main problem? It takes about four years to reach the planet from Texas. It’s all highly reminiscent of the Tom Hanks vehicle Cast Away, in which a man was left to his own devices, presumed dead, on a remote island.

So far, so intriguing, and with Ridley Scott in the director’s chair, a rollicking good time is all but guaranteed, right? Eh, wrong.

Certainly, The Martian looks lavish, as one might expect from Scott, who is the grand don of sci-fi. And while there’s no arguing with Damon’s movie-star credentials, he doesn’t carry the film in quite the same way as Tom Hanks did with Cast Away.

Watney is the fulcrum of the film, and sadly, the writers of The Martian (Drew Goddard and Andy Weir) haven’t fleshed out the character of Watney fully enough for us to be stuck with him for much of the movie.
Video of the Day

Certainly, he comes out with some witty one-liners to his video log (“potatoes with Vicodin for dinner. I ran out of ketchup this week”), but there’s no backstory, no interiority, and no look at the psychological ramifications of being alone in space for months on end.

He grows a beard and drops a few pounds; other than that, it seems as though Watney might be perfectly content to spend eternity in the ether once he had grub.

There’s plenty of scrimping, too, when it comes to using his comrades (played by a stellar list, among them Jessica Chastain and Rooney Mara). 

They’re all criminally underplayed and under-explored: Chastain’s character Lewis likes disco music, and that’s as far as we get with her. That there’s no sniff of a love interest or a family for Watney is a nicely skewed cliché, but this would have helped to get some meat on this otherwise paltry tale. Similarly, any efforts at tension, like Watney’s spuds coming a cropper, come to very little.

What we do get is a lot of science; in fact, we’re clobbered about the head with quantum physics and other technological jargon, constantly. Everyone sounds very clever and committed to their work… it’s just such a shame they’re all so boring.

If you’re a sci-fi nerd, there is plenty to like in The Martian. As Watney says, he will survive his time on Mars if he can ‘science the sh** out of this’. Sadly, you’ll feel every bit as scienced out.

It’s the nearest most of us will get to feeling like we’ve lived on Mars for an eternity. And that’s not saying a lot.",RUS_Doc9_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Negative,The Martian
219,RUS_Doc10_TheMartian,"Flashback to the films Interstellar and Gravity. Now hold that thought. This latest voyage into outer space places itself firmly between the two. It’s not as sterile as the former and not nearly as OMG entrancing as the latter. The entertainment value is steady, but once the premise is set, the storyline becomes predictable.

The screenplay by Drew Goddard, the ingenious writer of World War Z, is based on an original novel by computer programmer-turned-writer Andy Weir. Goddard’s hard task was to take a book filled with figures, science and math equations and bring it to life. What he has created is a screenplay full of vigor, somewhat conventional, oddly humorous, sometimes emotional and intermittently engaging. Director Ridley Scott adds directorial guidance and slick, professional production elements (think Prometheus). His glossy, overbearing style is balanced by the animated cast, which humanizes the characters.

On Mars, a space crew is carrying out their duties. A windstorm arrives. It becomes more and more intense and violent. They try to make it back to their landing vessel. Flying debris knocks astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) out of sight into a cloud of dust. It’s a tough choice, but Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) decides to hurry her subordinates back onboard, thinking Watney could not have survived the hit. Lewis and her crewmates (Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, Sebastian Stan) head back to earth, which is a yearlong journey.

Back on earth, the head of NASA (Jeff Daniels) holds a press conference, announcing Watney’s death. Little does anyone know that Watney survived. As a trained botanist and mechanical engineer, he figures out how to stretch rations, make water and grow potatoes. Everyone is shocked when a satellite’s camera picks up images of Mars, and they notice objects have been moved around. NASA and its California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory form a think tank with the brightest minds (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover) in an effort to communicate with the astronaut and devise a plan to bring him back to earth.

Damon’s warm sense of humor makes the stranded insular Watney affable. Hard not to like his plucky nature. Daniels as the head of NASA is most concerned with branding and his organization’s image in the media. Ejiofor’s earnest performance is a great contrast to Daniels’, as he plays NASA’s Director of Mars missions; a man more interested in the astronaut’s wellbeing. Donald Glover portrays an “orbital dynamicist” at JPL, and is suitably animated as a geek seeking solutions. Chastain, Pena and Mara are all fine within their limited amount of screen time. Saturday Night Live alumna Kristen Wiig, as an oddball media executive, gives an out-of-place performance, like she’s fleshing out a quirky character in an SNL skit in the middle of a dramatic movie.

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek), cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Prometheus), costumes by Janty Yatesav (Gladiator) and production design by Arthur Max (Prometheus) are near perfect at setting atmosphere. This is Ridley Scott’s strong suit as a producer; he always assembles a high-end, unflappable tech crew. But in some cases his grandiose production elements overwhelm the storyline and characters (Body of Lies, American Gangster).

If you see trailers for The Martian, and start to have a déjà vu experience, you are not alone. Matt Damon had an unbilled role in the film Interstellar where he also played a stranded astronaut. Only in that film he wasn’t such a nice guy. Why he decided to play the same kind of character in less than a year is a mystery only he and his agent can answer.

As 141 minutes roll by, the visuals (especially of Mars’s rusty orange/brown landscape), and performances (Damon and Ejiofor have the juiciest roles), help to pique interest and entertain. Yet this film feels like a retread and when you walk out of the theater you may not feel satiated. Something about this whole project feels like it should have been an extended TV series like Lost. It just doesn’t have the gravitas, originality or layers of undercurrent with far-reaching themes that made Gravity and 2001: A Space Odyssey better movies.

A half-hour into the Wizard of Oz, you can predict that Dorothy will make it back to Kansas. A half-hour into The Martian any seasoned moviegoer can figure out where the plotline in this feel-good movie has to go. That’s a shame and the film’s biggest transgression.",RUS_Doc10_TheMartian,RUS,Drama,Negative,The Martian
220,ASH_Doc1_Arrival,"Weve all seen ENOUGH films to know that when aliens eventually come to Earth, theyll do so for one of two reasons: theyll either be set on blowing us to bits, starting with our most famous landmarks, or if theyre cute ones, theyll be intent on befriending our most introverted children. Whichever their plan, its usually clear within minutes. Not so in Arrival. This astonishingly beautiful new film from Denis Villeneuve is all about what happens when communication is an apparent impossibility.As the film begins, alien ships have arrived in 12 locations across the globe. Theyre trying to give us a message, but we dont speak their language and they dont speak ours. Until someone figures out what theyre trying to say, theyre simultaneously friend and foe. Its Schrdingers Invasion. Louise (Amy Adams, movingly eloquent in a part that asks more silence of her than speech), a translator whos grieving the death of her daughter, is persuaded to attempt to speak to the aliens, with the help of a mathematician, Ian (Jeremy Renner). The aliens have no mouths, nor even faces, and dont produce anything wed recognise as writing, so where to start? The film becomes about how you go about understanding someone when theyre giving nothing away, and of course, its as much about decoding human nature as extra-terrestrial.Anyone hoping for an action blockbuster will be disappointed. This is an epic of quiet moments. The visual scale is large, but the ideas are larger. Villeneuve continues a faultless run  his last three films were Prisoners, Enemy and Sicario. He has a supreme ability to smooth out the complex. Theres a lot here that should be difficult to wrap your head around, but he holds our hand while also trusting us to assemble most of the puzzle. There are obvious comparisons here to Christopher Nolans Interstellar, which struggled to keep a grip on its biggest thoughts. Arrival doesnt. It makes the incredibly complicated emotionally simple. It makes you asks questions not just about whats out there, but whats in us.",ASH_Doc1_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Positive,Arrival

I love the direction and editing of this film. All those camera angles and shots made me feel what the protagonist was feeling. The first encounter with the alien literally scared me. That music is very amazing and so on point. Composers for science fiction films deserve all the praise.

Many elements are tackled throughout the two hour runtime, trying to communicate with the aliens, understanding their intentions as well as others which are unveiled once watching the film, however Arrival (2016) never feels silly, constantly grounded and engaging, also largely helped to the fantastic cinematography, the best in recent years. Familiar tropes are deployed, however Arrival (2016) executed them in a way which has never been done before and a way which remains unique to this film, which in time leads to one of the cheekiest plot twists in recent times, it all tops off one of sci-fi's greatest.",ASH_Doc3_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Positive,Arrival

They seem to be peacefully hovering over multiple cities, but aliens hovering, peacefully or not, is enough to make humans a little trigger-happy. However, Arrival is so much more than just creatures from outer space.Its about life and death, and what those words mean. Its about what words mean and what we mean when we use them. Its about the narrow way we see the world, only allowing us to perceive existence through duality. Its about the human experience, love, pain and potential regret. Sorry, I get carried away, there are also aliens.The creatures themselves look (and sound) unlike any off-world creatures seen on screen. The whole film is so stunningly realised, with every frame so gorgeously conceived and rendered and a story so eloquent, its a movie that benefits from more than one viewing.",ASH_Doc4_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Positive,Arrival

When several mysterious alien crafts appear throughout the world the U.S. Army recruits linguist professor Louise Banks to join a team of specialists that will attempt to make contact. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner lead the cast and deliver incredibly strong performances; especially Adams, who gives a career best. And the special effects and score do an effective job at setting a dark and foreboding tone. Also, the writing is extraordinarily ambitious (a little too much so at times) and explores some really interesting ideas. A smart and sophisticated film that challenged the audience, Arrival is remarkably compelling.",ASH_Doc5_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Positive,Arrival
225,ASH_Doc6_Arrival,"If our first contact with an alien race turns out to be as boring as this movie, then I hope it doesn't happen. Big disappointment considering the nominations, which makes it one of the most overrated movies of 2016. Their ships look stupid, the aliens themselves look stupider, and there's generally a lack of awe at this event. Only Jeremy Renner shows any signs of life, everyone else is sleepwalking including Amy Adams who is blander than Top 40 radio. She's a highly skilled linguist recruited by the military to communicate with these aliens, but none of her studying makes any difference as her only breakthroughs occur through memory flashes interacting with her daughter. Naturally the military gets trigger-happy solely in order to inject some form of tension which is utterly predictable. There's a fairly nifty revelation at the very end, but it's relied upon far too heavily to have a Shyamalan effect and cannot salvage the dreary experience until then. I enjoy heady sci-fi like Ex Machina and Interstellar as recent examples, but Arrival comes up well short with the only truly clever aspects being the aliens' writing method and the title. Opt for another viewing of Close Encounters instead.",ASH_Doc6_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Negative,Arrival

Neither of these stories is clear until the end, how they tie together is entirely by chance, though their tying together is entirely necessary for the alien's objective to work (I guess they got lucky?). Neither story is very compelling or satisfying at the end. It is not clear why this movie scored so high, it is not the least bit memorable. Also, it is a lame (and also not interesting) twist that Amy Adam's character knows she and Renner are going to marry, divorce and lose a child to cancer, but she doesn't tell him that outright.",ASH_Doc7_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Negative,Arrival

Jeremy Renner co-stars.How do you create a movie about space aliens and still make it seem new? This is the conundrum posed, and not all that ably resolved, by Arrival, which stars Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who is tasked by the US military with figuring out how to communicate with the squiggly, squidlike extraterrestrials whose spaceships, landed on Earth, resemble an immense ultrasleek cough drop.It begins promisingly, with scattershot TV reports of the alien landings inciting increasing dread. A reluctant Louise is recruited by an Army colonel (Forest Whitaker) to decode the squealing language of the aliens, whose spaceships are ominously parked at 12 locations around the world.But its difficult to get worked into a state of awe with this film because so much of it is so sodden. I half wished the aliens would blow something real big up just to break the monotony, but it turns out they are friendly  sort of. They eject squid ink-like messages that, once decoded, mean something like We come in peace. Turns out they want to literally change the way earthlings think by rewiring our brain circuits with their language, which, once learned, can alter our space-time continuum. Or at least Louises. Or something like that.I guess it doesnt matter exactly what this film is about. Except it does. When weve come this far, I rightly expect that all this  circle-of-time hoo-ha will amount to something more than a great big Huh? We have already been given a quick rundown on Louises fraught life leading up to this moment: the unexplained loss of her husband and the death of her only child, a daughter, to cancer. Her mournfulness is all of a piece with the films pallid, grayish ambience. Earth may well be worth saving, but Arrival doesnt exactly make the best case for it.A halfhearted attempt is made by the filmmakers to give Louise a love interest: a theoretical physicist, played by Jeremy Renner, whose quota of Aha! moments is thankfully kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, just about everything about this guy is kept to a minimum. Hes a plot device, except, of course, there isnt much of a plot.I realize Im not supposed to be so cavalier about a movie that clearly is aiming for Importance  not to mention Oscars  but it would take a hardier soul than I am to suppress a snicker when Louise enters the spaceships dismal, honeycombed interior, bravely sheds her orange hazmat suit, and holds up a sign saying Human.

228,ASH_Doc9_Arrival,"At first, they look like giant black eggs _hovering in the sky. Seen up close and in profile, they are more like the dark slashes in a Lucio Fontana canvas. These are the _extraterrestrial spacecraft in Arrival, which appear suddenly one morning and plonk themselves in assorted locations across the planet with little or no regard for parking restrictions.Arrival itself is less unexpected. Early November is the official launch period for adult-oriented science-fiction movies angling for awards recognition: Gravity, Inter_stellar and The Martian were all released in that slot and Arrival contains DNA carefully extracted from each. From Interstellar, it lifts a circular plot structure, signalled far in advance by an opening speech disputing the notion of beginnings and endings. From The Martian, it takes its pragmatic approach to a fantastical situation, represented in the new film by the challenge of communicating with alien visitors. Most importantly, Arrival borrows from Gravity a grieving female protagonist, in this case the linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is mourning the loss of her daughter.The screenwriter Eric Heisserer, working from a short story by Ted Chiang, knows that there can be no faster route to empathy than a dead child, and the director, Denis Villeneuve, finds the appropriate visual register for a montage of the girls life in the soft hues and artful blurs redolent of a commercial for private health care.Louise lives alone in a stylishly chilly waterfront property, far too pricey for an academic to afford but spacious enough to denote emotional desolation. So when the US government requests that she join the physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to instigate a conversation with the aliens, the project provides respite from her grief. Inside the spacecraft docked in Montana, they converse through a gleaming white rectangle that suggests a blank cinema screen. Tentacles figure strongly in the composition of the creatures, who communicate by honking like trombones and spraying inky characters on the screen for Louise to decipher.It is fitting that these splodges resemble Rorschach blots, since the film is concerned not with the enigmas of an exotic species but with what the extraterrestrials existence might reveal about the human race. Where Close Encounters of the Third Kind gazed outward in awe at the universe, Arrival asks only how its mysteries might provide succour and illumination for us. It couldnt be any more parochial in its outlook if Louise and Ian were shown posing for selfies with the aliens.As the story loops round on itself and Louises memories of her daughter start to provide clues and pointers, the film becomes carried away by its attempts at profundity. The past is the future . . . The future is the present . . . The child had a palindromic name . . . She made clay models that predicted what the aliens would look like . . . In a movie, the air of cosmic spookiness is less impressive than in life, because these are not really coincidences at all but markers placed in advance by the film-makers over the course of many drafts. A genuinely magical picture (Donnie Darko, say) generates a mystique that outlasts its plot surprises. Arrival is the opposite sort of film. Though secular in nature, its promises of continuous life make it as simplistically comforting as any religious parable.It may have escaped the directors atten_tion also that Nicolas Roeg has made a long and wonderful career out of exploring, with a good deal less fanfare, the idea that is central to his film. In Walkabout, Dont Look Now and Bad Timing, the past, present and future exist simultaneously and it takes only a snip of the editors scissors to move between those time frames.
For Villeneuve, however, cinema is all about making big statements, and damn the details. He doesnt notice, in the process of telling Louises story, that the aliens are relegated to the status of McGuffins in their own movie or that the entire world is nudged to the very brink of war just so that a well-off university professor can sleep more soundly at night.",ASH_Doc9_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Negative,Arrival
229,ASH_Doc10_Arrival,"Canadian director Denis Villeneuve made one great film in 2013 called Prisoners. Provocative, enthralling and beautifully composed, it peeled away the layers of a complex mystery story with a surprise in every frame. I was an instant fan. This promising relationship has come to a heartbreaking finale with every film since. Enemy and Sicario were unspeakable disasters, and Arrival, the directors latest exercise in pretentious poopery, gives me every reason to believe I have parted company with Denis Villeneuve for good.
TV anchormen on every channel pour out the news that 12 unidentified flying saucers have landed throughout the world, in places as far afield as Russia, Venezuela and Montana. Borders are closed (dont tell Donald Trump), gas is in such limited supply that theres no way to escape, and the president declares a state of emergency. Enter Amy Adams, as linguistics professor Dr. Louise Banks, and Jeremy Renner, as theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly, recruited by the U.S. military to find out what the aliens want, decipher their language through translation and ask them what their goals are. Never mind that Jodie Foster already solved the problem years ago, in Contact. Adams is more neurotic and short-fused, still grieving over the disappearance of her husband and the loss of her daughter from some inexplicable disease that may or may not have traveled from outer space. (I think it was cancer, but with this movie, cancer seems too logical, and who can tell?) Anyway, the spaceship she finds is an obelisk-shaped rock suspended above the ground, and the aliens inside it look like the grab-ass trees that threw apples at Judy Garland in Oz.The extraterrestrial quantum leap that follows takes almost two hours to unravel, and then nothing happens that makes one bit of sense. Adapted by Eric Heisserer from a bizarre story by sci-fi poseur Ted Chiang, Arrival is a weird flick, slow and tedious, too metaphysical for Rod Serlings The Twilight Zone and most likely to appeal to people who like to play video games and solve puzzles. One reviewer at last years Venice Film Festival, where this head scratcher was unveiled, praised the film for details of linguistic research and mathematical probability equations instead of the smash and grab of space conflicts in your typical sci-fi lunacies. Sorry, but Im one of those folks who prefers a little smash and grab, myself.Since nothing ever happens, Dr. Banks pronounces the aliens friendly and surmises that the news they want to share is about the future of the planet. Nobody believes her, so the alien ships finally withdraw. Language, they insist, is the only thing that links the species to the future of humanity. Unfortunately, the aliens dont really do anything but squeal like babies with colic, and theres nothing linear about their language, so theres nothing linear about the movie, either. Result: There is no beginning, no middle and no end. This might be O.K. for a language, but a movie has to start and end somewhere. Also, shes lost a child. But in the end, you realize the present is the future and the future is the past, or something. So the child Adams lost hasnt been born yet, and Renner, the new astrophysicist she falls for on a tour of the space ship, is going to be the lover she lost years ago, ready to father the baby, who will be called Hannah because the name is a palindrome. If you got all that, write it on a postcard and mail it to somebody who cares. I couldnt wait to call Arrival by the new name Departure.",ASH_Doc10_Arrival,ASH,Sci_Fi,Negative,Arrival
230,VXL_Doc1_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"Marvel really kicked it into high gear with their new release Guardians of the Galaxy. I am not a huge Marvel comic book reader (DC Fan here), so I glean what I can from Wikipedia and friends who read the comics (mostly Sam, my co-editor) but I do follow the cinematic universe pretty closely. Marvel has repeatedly done well with their movies, despite the hiccup I would call Iron Man 2, each film has been better than the last and Guardians is no exception.
Right off of the success of Captain America 2: Winter Soldier comes Guardians with another wonderful ensemble cast and a story unlike any we’ve previously seen. I have to hand it to Marvel for being able to make what might look like just a rag tag group of law breakers into heroes right before our eyes. Not many filmmakers and producers could take a bipedal talking raccoon and make him into the gem that is Rocket. The humor is spot on with this one, making it the most hilarious Marvel movie to date. While all the Marvel films have a light hearted side to their stories, the core plot is a serious one and you don’t find yourself laughing all the way through the movie like you do with Guardians.
Maybe it’s the wise-cracking Chris Pratt, who plays Peter Quill aka Star Lord, a new hero and ex-ravager who went from planet to planet as a thief. He’s a rogue and a sweet talker, with a not too honest smile, but you can’t help but root for him when he defends the little guy and saves the galaxy. Maybe it’s Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, playing the brilliant but snarky Rocket Raccoon and Groot, his plant/bodyguard who only says “I” and “am” and “Groot” and only specifically in that order. They fly off of the screen at the audience who can barely keep up with the jokes that they are throwing at the crowd.
I’ll be the first to admit when I saw the concept art for the movie, I was dubious. Having never even heard of Star Lord or Gamora, I was wondering why Marvel was doing this. Well that all turned around when I got a look at this movie. The story plays heavily on heart and laughs. While its fighting sequences don’t really match up to the triumphant Battle of New York in The Avengers, the plan is a solid one and shows off not only how intelligent the Guardians can be, but also how fearless. They know they are going into a fight where they have a 99% chance of dying. They are still willing to do it.
There are very few moments of lag in the film, mostly because of awesome work of music producing by Tyler Bates. The original soundtrack plus all of the 1970’s and 80’s music pulls the audience in the minute each catchy tune starts playing in your head. Even if you were raised without an ounce of that music in your system you still find yourself tapping your feet along with the tunes as they blast over the technicolor screen.
Despite heavy overtones of genocide and destruction set by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Ronan (Lee Pace) along with Nebula (Karen Gillan), the movie is light. There are a few tear jerker moments (though I am also a pretty big crybaby so maybe they aren’t that sad), but they are never unnecessary or tasteless like they so often can be. I found myself itching for more adventures with the Guardians in the end, and ready to jump on their ship to join them for more of saving the day.
Visually the movie is stunning, with colors that rival Pacific Rim and destinations like Xandar and Knowhere, this movie is a visual masterpiece. The leading cast do great with their alien surroundings, and the neon colors and unfamiliarities pique our curiosity and interest. The movie is otherworldly but never unreachable. It’s beautiful, and I’d argue it’s Marvel’s best work so far.",VXL_Doc1_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,VXL,Sci_Fi,Positive,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy
231,VXL_Doc2_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"Guardians of the Galaxy is unoriginal, insubstantial and most significantly, it’s not funny. Once touted as their riskiest film to date, it is artistically and politically as conservative a film as Marvel Studios has ever made. The disappointment of the space adventure is that it is little more than a retread of a pedestrian formula, the numbingly predictable scaffolding of the comic book and superhero genre, hidden under the disguise of a broad comedy. The film’s jokey banter, self-referential tone and pop culture references are smoke and mirrors used strategically to distract us from what is a threadbare narrative of unimaginative climaxes. When the film pauses briefly between action sequences lifted from Star Wars and the digital imagery of video games like Mass Effect it is to pursue an ideological viewpoint that doesn’t inspire or rewrite the blockbuster but merely redecorates it. The film’s values for family and nostalgia are not to be mistaken for depth or thematic goals but compulsory staples of Marvel’s production line, the intention of which is to preserve the genre’s wide commercial appeal while drastically limiting the variety of what mainstream Hollywood chooses to explore.

The film is an adaptation of Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning’s comic book with James Gunn directing and co-writing the script with Nicole Perlman. It opens in 1988 with a young boy named Peter Quill listening to a cassette tape in a hospital. His father is absent and his mother is on her deathbed. Under insanely melodramatic circumstances, she passes away right before he can take her hand. After he steps outside the hospital he is abducted by an alien spaceship. The film is extremely vague about what happened next and what his reaction was to being taken away as a child. Instead, the story forwards twenty-six years later to when Peter (played by Chris Pratt) is now a trained smuggler and explorer of alien worlds. He is also still carrying the same cassette player with him, allowing him to play many of the film’s retro tunes. Peter stumbles upon a magical orb of power, which he learns is too dangerous for him to sell. It is wanted by a powerful samurai-like villain named Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Also in pursuit of the orb are a number of different misfits including an alien named Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a fast-talking, aggressive raccoon aptly named Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his anthropomorphic tree friend Groot (the voice of Vin Diesel) and a muscular warrior named Drax (Dave Bautista). Each of these characters has different reasons for wanting the orb or for stopping their enemy Ronan as they become the guardians and protectors of this space world.

What Guardians extracts from this plot is not to parody the superhero genre like Gunn’s previous film Super but to continue Hollywood’s two most formulaic and overused ideological goals: individualism and the restoration of the family unit. Although the guardians are touted as being misfits and losers this is not a character study. The guardians are more like action figurines, distinguished by their bizarre appearances, catch phrases and one-liners, while their suit gadgets and weapons become a cliché expression of how individual talents can save the world. Initially setting the film in the 1980s is also crucial to understanding Marvel’s ideological complacency. This time period means that much of the film is encompassed in Reaganesque values, who in his terms in office stressed the importance of sustaining the American family. The guardians reflect this ideology because a number of them are tormented by comic book clichés like avenging their families who died at Ronan’s hand. Dead parents syndrome is abound. Similarly, the guardians become integral in resolving Peter’s desire for a new family, which is climaxed by possibly the most unintentionally Freudian moment in a superhero film. An extended hand from one character to Peter recalls memories of his mother. But Peter Quill’s transformation from a womanising man-child, into a more caring, selfless family man, is not a change at all. His arc is merely synonymous with Hollywood’s narrow and formulaic ideological aims about the goodness found in people when conforming to Western and Christian values like the family unit.

The reason Marvel has employed an immobile, nostalgic lead character is because they want the adult audience to have a synonymous emotional reaction. As they are unwilling to change the formula of these films, the studio risks losing its adult audience as they grow older. As such, everything here is geared towards the past and makes no promises for future directions of this genre. The director and his writer know this because in a deliberate move to make adults comfortable with being adolescent again they resort to including “mature” references and jokes about The Maltese Falcon, Jackson Pollock and a soundtrack comprised of hit tunes from the 1970s. In the end these are superficial additions, aimed to nudge the nostalgic ribs of the adult audience and to deter us from how dreary this action-comedy formula has become. The narrative in Guardians is terribly slight, running out of steam before the end and padded extensively with tension-free set pieces where characters are rarely hurt. Much of the exposition involving the film’s forgettable villains is confusing and rushed, especially for people like myself who haven’t read the comics. It is also unfathomable that after this many films in Marvel’s universe they are still relying on something as derivative as a MacGuffin device to rigidly string action sequences together. The most telling moment throughout the whole film though is at the story’s apex, when Peter confronts one of his enemies and says that he is distracting him. It is a moment of metafiction because comedic elements like this are simply papering over what has become formulaic and all too predictable from Marvel.

232,VXL_Doc3_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit, action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at. That just this little is enough to take ""Guardians"" into the realm of ""not bad"" says more about the state of action than it does about the movie itself.
It deals with an effort to save ""the galaxy,"" but this is a notion without emotion. We are shown nothing about this particular galaxy that should make us care whether it gets saved or blown up like Vulcan in ""Star Trek"" (2009). There's no burning reason to root for one set of spaceships over the other. Rather, the mere concept of ""saving the galaxy"" is supposed to engage the audience - for two hours.
Yes, there are jokes, but most of these are along the lines of the movie's making fun of itself before we all notice there's nothing to take seriously. In place of wit, ""Guardians"" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening - and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it.
As for the three-dimensional visuals, there's little here that couldn't have been rendered just as well in two. In fact, the three dimensions just dim the movie into murkiness, making the experience too much like watching it with sunglasses on. Taking the 3-D glasses off during the close-ups provides the occasional relief.
The movie starts with a poorly acted but recognizably human situation, of a little boy saying goodbye to his mother, who is on her deathbed. After she dies, he stumbles out of the hospital, inconsolable. And just as we're forgetting the kind of movie we've signed up for, a flying saucer shows up - as unwelcome and as out of place as any fictional flying saucer in history - and beams the boy on board.
Twenty-six years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is a merry, roving space rogue, a happy-go-lucky fellow flying through the universe, living off his smarts, so it's a wonder he doesn't starve to death. He comes upon a metal orb, about the size of a softball, which apparently everyone wants for some intense yet unspecified purpose. Suffice it to say, it's like the ring in ""The Lord of the Rings"" or the little box that raised hell in the ""Hellraiser"" series.
Most of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" consists of Peter trying to hold on to the orb, or trying to get the orb back, or trying to prevent someone from doing something really horrible with it. The actual powers of the orb aren't quite specified. The powers are there for the convenience of the screenwriters, to allow great but not ultimate damage, to make things always desperate but never hopeless, dangerous but still doable.

233,VXL_Doc4_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"There is an enjoyable sequence early in director James Gunn’s otherwise busy and dispiriting Marvel comic-book adaptation of Guardians of the Galaxy that prepares the palate for original flavors otherwise absent. Chris Pratt of Parks and Recreation dials it down a level to play Peter Quill, the film’s mysteriously orphaned space bandit protagonist. Under the opening credits, Quill joyfully dances through a marshy alien landscape to the tune of Redbone’s AM radio staple “Come and Get Your Love,” at one point grabbing a CGI alien reptile to use as a prop microphone.

It’s an ecstatic scene, joyful and self-effacing where every other Marvel smirk-fest of late has been getting dreadfully solemn about its own gobbledygook. There is an exhilarating impression that the film may actually have the guts to surrender to Pratt’s Kool-Aid Man chaos, but the feeling is short-lived. Soon, we’re stuck following magical orbs and infinity stones with the awesome power to do things I never really cared about, and Pratt’s dizzy charm is pushed aside in favor of plot-heavy predictability and Marvel Universe-building.

Once again, the bad guys are mush-faced nonentities with vague agendas who talk like condescending schoolmarms. Once again, the main baddie Ronan (Lee Pace) is portrayed and described as a “religious extremist” and a “terrorist” (cough, radical Muslim, cough). Once again, characters blather on about peace treaties instead of anything interesting or cool. Once again, the plot hinges on our heroes saving an entire planet from destruction. Once again, any potential character investment is spent on blobby CGI, sentimental-message mongering and a nonsensical third-act light show that refuses to end.

Does any of this sound depressingly familiar? In last year’s equally hollow Thor: The Dark World, the climax took place in a red cloud; here, it takes place in a purple cloud. Progress! With an ensemble cast that includes a talking raccoon and a sentient, self-reproducing tree, Guardians of the Galaxy is more ostensibly a “comedy” than other Marvel properties like Thor and Captain America, but it offers roughly the same amount of jokey and juvenile bickering as those other films. Far from upending the Marvel formula, this is just another entry in its spreadsheet, The Avengers minus the monstrous egos.

After Quill takes off with the orb, he becomes the target of intergalactic bounty hunters—first, a beautiful, green-skinned Ronan loyalist (Zoe Saldana) whose motivation changes whenever the pace lags, and then an acerbic talking raccoon named Rocket. Bradley Cooper voices the role of Rocket, and Vin Diesel provides the grunts of his sidekick Groot, an anthropomorphic tree who can only speak the words, “I am Groot,” yet who still holds an easy rapport with the raccoon.

Rocket and Groot’s friendship is the most successful aspect of the film, and suggests the same sort of deep affection between fantastical creatures that made the original Star Wars universe so fascinating. It’s a likeable cast all around, especially when WCW wrestler Dave Bautista joins the team as Drax, a musclebound, blotched-red alien with a grudge against Ronan. I want to see a movie with these actors playing these characters learning and bonding through their adventures, but the problem is that Gunn can barely squeeze in a few minutes of uninspired squabbling and pat lesson-learning between nonthreatening, nonstop special effects fireworks and inconsequential plot garbage.

Before that sublime “Come and Get Your Love” sequence described above, Guardians of the Galaxy indulges in a little universe building of its own. In a brief precredits scene, a young Peter sees his mother die from cancer, and overwhelmed with grief, he escapes into a nearby field, where he gets picked up by a passing spaceship. Quill’s origin story is then ignored until the conclusion, and this scene only adds two more plot MacGuffins for Gunn to juggle, all leading to an unconvincing “swing away” moment.

Of course, the real point is to create a through line to the next movie: Just like everything else in the Marvel cinematic universe, Guardians of the Galaxy exists solely to advertise its own as-yet-unmade sequels.",VXL_Doc4_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,VXL,Sci_Fi,Negative,Guardians_of_the_Galaxy
234,VXL_Doc5_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"After a down-to-earth prologue featuring a young boy witnessing the last breaths of his mother, we are brought to a strange world. It is a desolate planet that is home to the remnants of an ancient, alien civilization. Our hero is searching for something, using his high-tech visor to see into the past glory of this world. He finds the hub of this dead society, puts on a pair of headphones, and pushes a button on his portable cassette player. Suddenly, the soundtrack is filled with the rubbery guitar riff that signals the opening of Redbone's ""Come and Get Your Love"" (the first of many inspired musical selections). Our hero starts dancing through the ruins—kicking at little, rat-like creatures and soaring across a ravine with rocket-propelled boots.

The opening sequence of Guardians of the Galaxy (the one following the rather depressing prologue, obviously) is a delight. The playfulness of the scene tears right through the familiar setup and surroundings to create a sense of unpredictability. It promises a movie that will not take itself seriously but will have fun with the conventional stuff of space adventures and comic-book fare. The rest of the movie seems set on proving that old adage about the reason promises are made.

Just when we think co-writer/director James Gunn has provided a distinct identity to this story of a team of five oddities on intragalatic escapades, the screenplay by Gunn and Nicole Perlman (based on the comic series by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning) overwhelms that spirited tone with the usual stuff. We're offered the threat of massive destruction from a generic villain, who exists in the story solely to give the heroes something big and important to do in the third act. We get the mythos of some inanimate object that has rules but really does anything the screenplay requires of it. It doesn't matter if it's consistent in what it does from one scene to the next; it just has to move the story forward.

We're presented with a mess of characters, each of whom has little individual personality. Perhaps each of them has a unique character somewhere under the surface. We only know, though, what we see, and we see them waste a lot of words discussing that object—an item that one character has dismissed with multiple examples as an unimportant MacGuffin.

What we get is a whole lot of plot about interspecies diplomacy and planetary destruction and trips from one world to another. Occasionally, characters crack wise about each other or some story development. In other words, we get a typical space adventure but one that is overloaded with a wobbly sense of self-satisfaction.

The bright spot is the main cast of misfits. There's the human Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), the boy from the prologue 26 years later. He's a thief and member of a group called the Ravagers, who abducted him from Earth. He is very disappointed that no one knows him by his nickname ""Star-Lord."" In the scene in the ruins, Quill has taken a mysterious orb that only a few people know of and even less want, due to the destructive power inside it.

There's Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a humanoid alien who is the adopted daughter of Thanos—another humanoid alien (Unless otherwise noted, just assume all of the aliens look mostly human) with ambitions to rule the galaxy. She is also one of the chief warriors of—and here's a name for you—Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), yet another villain who wants to rule the galaxy.

Drax (Dave Bautista) is a muscle-bound, tattoo-covered alien with a vast lexicon and an inability to comprehend metaphor. The last two are more than a bit different. Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is a genetically-modified and cybernetically-enhanced raccoon bounty hunter with a gun fetish, and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) is an anthropomorphic tree with a five-word vocabulary.

Aside from their physical appearances, there isn't much that distinguishes these characters. As a result of some standard-issue back story, each of them has a chip the size of a dwarf planet on his or her shoulder, and they all react to difficulty with sarcasm and a bad attitude. The exception is Groot, but obviously, he isn't much of a conversationalist. There's a pattern to their dialogue and jokes, such as the way Quill contextualizes information using pop-culture references from the 1980s (One would think he'd have wider pool of knowledge after over two decades of exploring the galaxy) or how Rocket wants to kill or maim almost everyone he encounters. These interactions don't necessarily grow tiresome, but they do feel almost as repetitive as the movie's near-constant devotion to delivering exposition.

The movie's worlds are eye-catching in a general way, from a utopian metropolis to a spaceship prison, but they are just plot markers, lacking specifics. The action sequences are also nondescript, and the climax is an arduous sequence of visual pollution consisting of bright colors and frantic, unintelligible motion. There's a strong, likeable start to Guardians of the Galaxy, but from there, the movie begins a persistent slide into anonymity.

235,VXL_Doc6_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"“The Guardians of the Galaxy will return.”
So says the onscreen text at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy, reminding me not only of the franchise prerogative that defines almost every Marvel film (the final five minutes of this one mainly consist of sequel setup), but also of the way the television cartoons I watched as a kid would segue into commercial breaks. Sometimes I feel like real life has become nothing but a commercial break between Marvel movies.
Not that I’m down on Marvel. The studio has managed to squeeze an impressive amount of personality into what is essentially a huge commercial enterprise, and that continues with Guardians, the latest adaptation of one of its comic-book properties. The story centers on a reluctant team of interstellar fugitives who are forced to work together to defeat a common enemy, and its saving grace is the smart casting, charismatic performances and palpable chemistry among the leads.
Most amusing is Rocket, a genetically enhanced, talking raccoon with a cynical attitude and a talent for tech (Bradley Cooper provides the voice). Rocket’s right-hand “humanoid plant” is a walking tree named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Gamora (a green-skinned Zoe Saldana) is a grim assassin, while Drax (Dave Bautista) is a humorless muscleman. Leading them all, with reluctance, is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a human who was abducted from Earth as a child and now roams the galaxy as a scavenger of rare items – something like Indiana Jones, only with a cool space mask rather than a fedora.
If this motley crew shares anything in common aside from their enemy (a megalomaniacal warlord played by Lee Pace), it’s the thrill of the kill. Rocket prefers assault weapons; Gamora scissor kicks; Drax knives; Groot impaling. Quill has phasers of some sort but he also likes to grin from the corner as his teammates slaughter. It’s all fairly standard action fare, but the extra layer of comic callousness does undercut the movie’s more sentimental gestures. Here and there, Rocket or Gamora will pause and share their tale of woe, which is rooted in some sort of loss. It’s hard to take seriously when they immediately turn around and flippantly inflict loss on someone else.
There’s a certain level of hypocrisy here that’s difficult to accept.
Much of Guardians of the Galaxy, in fact, is pitched at the tone of that much-debated scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, in which Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones, confronted by a sword-wielding assassin, calmly shrugs, pulls out his pistol and shoots the guy dead. (Throughout Guardians, Pratt has the insouciant charm of a young Ford.) Deaths are punch lines in Guardians of the Galaxy until the movie needs them for pathos; there’s a certain level of hypocrisy here that’s difficult to accept.
Another nod to Raiders comes during an early scene in which Quill retrieves the artifact that will become this movie’s MacGuffin. Supremely self-aware about the pop-culture water it’s swimming in, Guardians then has Quill refer to the object as a MacGuffin and even mentions The Maltese Falcon, perhaps the greatest MacGuffin movie of all time. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is so stuffed with pop-culture references that if you removed them the entire movie would likely collapse. Quill refers to an alien adversary at one point as a “Ninja Turtle” and later calls Rocket “Ranger Rick.” He woos Gamora by referencing Footloose. Even in its structure and milieu (the director is James Gunn), the movie is a Lucas-Spielberg hybrid, yet another Star Wars star child with alien backdrops and a climactic sequence of parallel conflicts.
For those of us immersed in popular culture, such touches can bring a chuckle of delight (and I laughed at a few here). But there also has to be a ceiling for this sort of thing, a point after which the pop-culture universe no longer envisions anything new but instead begins to fold in on itself. When, I wonder, did our movies become the equivalent of an issue of Entertainment Weekly?
There can be compelling, thematic reasons for sprinkling a film’s story with elements of popular culture. The way Guardians of the Galaxy incorporates hit songs from the 1970s and early ’80s – they’re from a mix tape that Quill’s mother made before he was taken from Earth – is a good example. But too often these days, when a movie refers to another movie, or a song or a real-life star, it’s to parasitically siphon the attachment the audience has to the thing being referenced (largely because there’s nothing for us to latch onto in the movie at hand). Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t quite that empty – it has those fun characters – but it’s still a discouraging part of this wearying trend.

236,VXL_Doc7_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"There’s no doubt that Marvel is running on all cylinders. The Avengers set a new precedent for what was expected from the franchise, and since then, Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has delivered on all fronts. Two of the strongest Marvel movies, Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, have been released through Phase 2, and now, arguably its greatest effort has been unveiled.
From the get-go, Guardians of the Galaxy brings us into its vast universe of intricate CGI. The way it builds its world (or worlds) is truly fascinating. Every painstaking detail translates on screen and you find yourself securely immersed in this ravaged section of celestial magic. Everything feels and looks real, though it’s obviously not. Here’s a movie that can easily be another great-looking, self-serious addition to the gritty side of superhero films set in space.
Yet, it’s not. Not even a little bit.
The thing that makes Guardians of the Galaxy so wonderful is that it’s completely bonkers! There’s no way to make a serious film with a sentient tree that can only tell you its name. (“I am Groot”). The producers know it, and best of all, James Gunn knows it. So, it’s pretty obvious that James Gunn was given a lot to play with and for that, I am truly thankful. He took the term “sci-fi epic” and turned it on its head.
Chris Pratt leads the cast of misfits quite ably. I had my reservations about Chris Pratt as a leading man, though he had been showing some range recently, but he performs marvelously as the 70’s music-loving rogue, Peter Quill (or “Star Lord” as he likes to be called.) Under the employment of Yondu (“The Walking Dead’s” Michael Rooker) Quill is a treasure hunter who finds a mysterious orb with little expectation of what’s about to transpire. See, this orb contains a power that Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) and his, let’s say, immense, boss are very much interested in acquiring. Ronan is hellbent on universal destruction, as a comic book villain is wont to do. And this orb is definitely going to make that a goal that’s a bit easier to attain.
Thus begins an epic space adventure that sees Quill team up with Thanos’ orphaned daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a scorned alien prisoner who doesn’t understand metaphors named Drax (played incredibly by Dave Bautista), and the tandem of Rocket (a genetically engineered talking raccoon indistinguishably voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Groot (adorable in a very deadly way and voiced by Vin Diesel), who end up stealing the show. Together, they form the unlikely team of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Their mission: stop the orb from getting into the wrong hands, and possibly make money off of it in the process. Hey, what more do you expect from a group that formed together in prison?
From then on, bombastic action sequences explode on screen, segmented by the best scenes in the movie: the interactions between the newly united crew. From trying to figure out whether they’re forming a plan or a “concept” of a plan to Quill trying to use his womanizing charms on Gamora, there’s so much fun and excitement that the two hours just melt away. In all, it’s a movie that, much like its phenomenal soundtrack, borrows a lot of elements from similar genre films of the 70’s and 80’s. You definitely get the feel of Han Solo when you see Chris Pratt doing his thing on screen, and the futurescape we get from the film is tangentially retro. And I’m very serious about the soundtrack. It’s so good, I’m listening to it while I write this review.
A lot of the commendation needs to fall on James Gunn. This is his first big-budget effort, and he didn’t have to sacrifice his wit or sharpness to make a labor of love. He was able to present a film that pieced together elements of testosterone, geekiness, nostalgia, sweetness, drama, and loads of comedy almost flawlessly. This movie had success written all over it thanks to his determined vision and strong cast of characters. There’s a reason such an obscure comic was greenlit for a sequel before it was determined if it would be successful. And I, for one, cannot wait until the inevitable crossover with the Avengers.
Guardians of the Galaxy is not your typical superhero film, and it doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not. You’re gonna feel two things coming out of this movie: a childlike excitement for a sci-fi action movie, and discomfort in your pain-stricken face from uproarious laughter. More fun comic book films please!

237,VXL_Doc8_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"I’ve been saying for months now that this is the Summer of Good Sci-Fi (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Edge of Tomorrow, Snowpiercer, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) but the one that needed to be good in order to make this theory of mine hold the proper amount of water was the biggest wild card, James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, the tenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but in many ways a huge risk, considering that it takes place somewhere other than Earth and uses characters only the staunchest of comic book fans will have heard of. All it had to do was be good. Not great, not perfect, just good. Luckily it was great and almost perfect so I shouldn’t have worried at all. I don’t think I’ve seen a more enjoyable, exciting, and FUNNY sci-fi movie, maybe ever.
Marvel’s first full foray into their Cosmic titles, Guardians of the Galaxy doesn’t feel much like the movies the company has made in the past, and that’s a good thing. There isn’t a “superhero” to latch onto or anything close to the kind of troubles we’ve seen in any of the other films. Even the massive planet-in-danger finale felt like a completely different take on the the idea; certainly it’s nowhere like what happened in The Avengers or Thor: The Dark World which are the closest in terms of scope and spaceyness. With a healthy amount of references to Star Wars, allusions to things like The Wild Bunch and The Dirty Dozen, and way more jokes, heart, and character development than anyone could have imagined, Guardians is a here of a fun two hours.
The story’s main Guardian is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), an Earth kid who is abducted by aliens on possibly the worst and most painful day of his young life. 20 years later, Quill, calling himself “Star-Lord,” is a thief working for blue space pirate Yondu (Michael Rooker). Quill enters a temple and steals an orb that he doesn’t know why it’s important, he just knows it’s worth a lot. Unfortunately, someone else is looking for the orb. Guards working for the Kree zealot Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) are aiming to give the orb to him so that the nasty blue fellow can fulfill his desire for vengeance against the seemingly peaceful world of Xandar.
After managing to get away from the guards, and double-crosses Yondu, Quill attempts to sell the orb himself. Unfortunately, now lots of people want to get him. Ronan sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an assassin and adopted daughter of the evil Thanos, to retrieve the orb, much to the chagrin of Thanos’ actual daughter Nebula (Karen Gillan). And also, Yondu has placed a bounty on Quill’s head and genetically engineered Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his monosyllabic humanoid tree friend Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) want to collect. After a big scuffle, which is but one of the film’s highlights, all four end up at a massive intergalactic prison wherein they meet Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), a maniac who wants revenge on Ronan for the death of his family. Turns out, Gamora doesn’t like Ronan any more than the rest of them and they decide to team up to break out of prison and put the orb into safe hands, or at least well-paying hands. But nothing’s ever that simple, is it?
There is a LOT of plot going on at all times and I think one of the best things Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman were able to do was give us all this plot in a way that didn’t feel like just a huge info-dump. This has to be one of the tightest and freshest scripts of any big-budget action movie of the past 20-some years. Every joke lands, every action is motivated by character, and the plot unfolds in a way that makes sense and doesn’t feel forced or convenient. In fact, nothing is convenient for the Guardians and that’s why they’re so great; they actually have to work for what they’re getting.
Visually, this is simply a stunning movie. The colors and textures of everything pop off the screen, and not only because of the stereoscopy. The costumes and set design feel “real” and very space-age all at once, and the ships (which I was particularly excited to see) are cool looking. There are space battles and fistfights, chases and sight-gags, and even a touching moment (or seven), and Gunn shoots them all just about perfectly. I also applaud the use of makeup for a lot of the humanoid aliens and only CGI being used for Rocket and Groot, and our pal Thanos, of course. It gives the movie a tactile, throwback feel to space operas of the post-Star Wars ilk, when all we had were made-up people.
One of the best and most prevalent touches in the film, besides the dialogue, is the use of music. It’s built into the movie that Peter Quill’s mother gave him a mix tape when he was kid in 1988 and that it’s the only thing he has to remember her after he’s abducted. Songs from this tape, all pop, soul, and rock songs from the 1970s, play throughout the movie and are indicative of the tone the movie strikes. Quill is very much a human in the midst of all these weird aliens and the music really drives that point home. He doesn’t lament being taken away from his family, but he needs this music to feel like a person. And it’s all great music, by the way.
The characters are all fantastic and humorous and sympathetic in their own way. They’re all a bit batty and that’s why we love them. All five of our main characters are fabulously played, but Rocket steals the show in a lot of ways, because his attitude is just so Joe-Pesci-Livewire. If there’s a downside at all it’s that I wish Ronan the Accuser and Nebula had gotten more to do. Pace gives a great performance, and he’s pretty damn terrifying, but he doesn’t ever get to be much more than a snarling, murderous despot. Minor beef, but it’s there.
In summation, friends, Guardians of the Galaxy is first-class, Grade-A space adventure comedy. It’s easily one of my top 3 Marvel movies, and close to the top of my list of movies I’ve seen in 2014. It’s fun, it’s great, it’s got badassery galore; go see it!

238,VXL_Doc9_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"If you’re old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun, “Guardians of the Galaxy” will be your new favorite movie. If you’re not, it will set a standard for everything you see.
From Flash Gordon to Mad magazine, a bent wing of the starship American Enterprise steered pop culture in a loopy direction. But ever since “Star Wars” devolved into daddy issues, genre entertainment has gotten grim and grandiose. Now every popcorn movie has a dark center, and sometimes it’s the hero.
Whizzy, wondrous and wildly funny, “Guardians” is the first Marvel release that rightly could be called a comedy. But notwithstanding the talking tree and the gun-toting raccoon, it’s so much more than a spoof of space operas or a freeze-ray aimed at doleful competitor DC Comics. It’s an instant classic, a game-changer worthy of Spielberg or Lucas.
The maestro is Missourian James Gunn, whose previous movies were modest-budget exercises in body horror (“Slither”) and superhero psychoanalysis (“Super”). Left to his own devices, Gunn has a sinister sense of humor; but given a bottomless pot of Marvel’s gold, he has built a vehicle that can accommodate fanboys and families alike, with room in the back seat for a big, beating heart.
On a technical level, it’s astonishing, with World of Tomorrow cityscapes and pop-flavored 3-D imagery that demand to be seen on a big screen. On a storytelling level, it’s a back-to-the-future flashback to the misfit crew of the Millennium Falcon, with a ’70s soundtrack transporting us to a mallplex far, far away.
The AM-radio hits are on a cassette inherited by an earthling named Peter Quill when his mother dies in 1988. At the end of that Spielbergian prelude, the grieving boy is levitated from outer-ring St. Louis to outer space, where he becomes an adventurer who calls himself Starlord (Chris Pratt). Like Indiana Jones, the cocksure explorer plunders artifacts, and when he finds a mystical orb on an abandoned planet, he double-crosses his kidnapper/benefactor Yondu (Michael Rooker).
But there are other creatures who covet the whatzit, including pint-size pirate Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper), Rocket’s leafy, tri-syllabic sidekick Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) and a green-skinned assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who may or may not be working for evil overlord Ronan (Lee Pace).
Busted while bickering over the booty (by flatfoot John C. Reilly), the fantastic four are sent to a space prison where they reluctantly form a team of do-gooders with the addition of vengeful hulk Drax (Dave Bautista), who blames Ronan for the death of his wife and child.
Family looms large in this story, based on a cult comic by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Zamora’s sister (Karen Gillan) is a deadly enforcer for their evil father, Thanos, and Peter still has unresolved questions about his own father (which are likely to be addressed in the just-announced sequel). The punchline is that the misfit Guardians form a family of their own, rooted in the cosmic consciousness of Groot.
With only three words at his disposal, Diesel manages to hijack several scenes as the seven-foot Groot, while the ballistic banditry of Rocket Raccoon is a guilty pleasure writ small. But it’s Pratt who steals the movie, with a mix of charm and sarcasm that Harrison Ford couldn’t muster with a time machine.
Surrender, earthlings. It’s the Guardians’ world and you’ll be happy to live in it.

239,VXL_Doc10_GuardiansOfTheGalaxy,"Attitude is everything in Guardians Of The Galaxy. Other comicbook adaptations sweat and strain over the unbearable burden of knowing that great power carries great responsibility.
This swashbuckling space age romp treats saving the universe as just a bit of fun. Very refreshing and probably just as well.
The garbled plot is nothing to write home about and seems to mostly revolve around everyone being in hot pursuit of an unimpressive metal orb that looks more like a fixture from the Ikea lighting department than something with enough power to destroy the known galaxy. Stifle that yawn and just step on board for the ride.
Guardians Of The Galaxy feels like the sum of many parts of Star Trek, Galaxy Quest, Stagecoach and early Star Wars, especially Star Wars. It has the unpretentious, cliffhanging, Saturday morning razzle dazzle that made George Lucas’s original film so exciting.
Chris Pratt is very much the Harrison Ford of Guardians. Pratt has charm and sex appeal to spare but he also has impeccable comic instincts and makes Peter Quill a mixture of dashing hero, devil-me-care buccaneer and goofy blithe spirit. If this film and this performance don’t elevate him to A-list stardom then I’ll eat my sonic screwdriver.
Peter is just a spit of a lad in 1988 when he is abducted by aliens immediately after the death of his mother. Blue-skinned alien rogue Yondu (Michael Rooker) becomes his mentor. The main bulk of the film takes place 26 years later but Peter will always be that child of the 1980s down to his love of Footloose and his fondness for an awesome mix tape of iconic sounds from the period including Cherry Bomb and Hooked On A Feeling.
In 2014, Peter is now a bounty hunter/scavenger on a mission to retrieve that Ikea orb. That is what places him in the middle of the age-old war between Kree and Xandar and makes him a target for the evil Ronan (Lee Pace), a character who looks like a cross between the golem and Darth Vader.
The film still has a lot of explaining to do but perhaps it doesn’t matter as Peter is soon part of a merry band of good guy misfits who eventually assume their role as, you guessed it, guardians of the galaxy. They are Zoe Saldana’s nimble, green-skinned warrior Gamora, muscleman Drax (Dave Bautista), monosyllabic tree creature Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and, best of all  Rocket, a wily, wisecracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. Together, they are the magnificent five, the dirty quintet, the A-team of intergalactic heroes. You get the picture.
Inevitably, Guardians Of The Galaxy eventually surrenders to the special-effects team and becomes a gung-ho demonstration of big screen spectacle full of daring escapes, fights to the death, dogfights  and endless explosions. It retains just enough of its hip, jokey manner to forgive this turn towards the conventional.
A strong cast also includes Karen Gillan as the lethal Nebula and cameos for Benicio Del Toro as The Collector and Glenn Close (still in Cruella De Vil make-up) apparently) as Prime Nova.
The plot may not bear close scrutiny but this is still ridiculously good fun and even leaves you feeling you could manage a little more. In best James Bond fashion we are told in the end credits that Guardians Of The Galaxy will return.
I’m looking forward to it.

240,OFZ_Doc1_PACIFICRIM,"In a world where Hollywood is mainly churning out sequels, remakes and adaptations for use as blockbuster fodder, Pacific Rim is an original idea. One that has a familiar story and takes obvious influences from many areas, but original nonetheless. It’s a risky move to put this much money into such an outlandish idea, especially when there’s little established fanbase to fall back on. Is this a gamble that pays off, or does it crash harder than a dead monster impacting on hard ground?
Pacific Rim does a great job of quickly and interestingly establishing the world and history of the film. The backstory and environment is dense with detail, but it never manages to feel overwhelming or ridiculous. This is a living, breathing world and a very fun playground with plenty of potential for expansion. The plot is formulaic for sure, with plenty of story and character clichés. But it all gels together because the world is so well-defined and characters fleshed out enough that you don’t mind. As much action as there is in Pacific Rim, there is plenty of drama and character to back it up. Of course, comparisons to Michael Bay’s Transformers films are inevitable, but Pacific Rim doesn’t fall into the same traps those films kept falling into. Our characters are likable and engaging; archetypes for sure but not so blatantly. These characters are the centre of the action instead of just people to run away from it. There’s no military mumbo-jumbo to distract you, no out-of-place comedy in the middle of the destruction. When the film gets into action gear, it is exhilarating, refreshing and, most important of all, comprehensible. Combine all that with terrific pacing that makes a two-hour plus movie feel like a breeze, and you’ve got yourself a fun time at the multiplex.

Charlie Hunnam takes centre stage as protagonist Raleigh Beckett and he does a fine job, but he is honestly the least interesting character in a sea of colourful supporting roles. Rinko Kikuchi (having finally grasped the English language after her mute role in The Brothers Bloom) is an engaging actress with a strong character to back her up. It is great to see a film with a male/female duo where the connections and conflicts doesn’t stem from romance, and Hunnam and Kikiuchi make a believable partnership when on screen together. Idris Elba is his awesome self as usual, barking orders and being all mentor-ish, and gets to make a brief badass speech that rivals President Bill Pullman from Independence Day. Del Toro regular Ron Perlman also makes a brief but brilliant appearance that is cemented by his ridiculous choice of wardrobe. But the real scene-stealers (other than the all the robots and monsters, of course) are Charlie Day and Burt Gorman as a pair of screwy scientists that are constantly at each other’s throats. They provide the comedic relief for the film, and in the hands of lesser actors it could have fallen into Skids and Mudflap territory. But Day and Gorman put their all into it and they are both excellent whether together or apart.

Guillermo Del Toro is one of the most unique and interesting directors working in the biz today, and he has finally been given enough of a budget to go all out crazy. All the promise shown in Pan’s Labyrinth, Blade II and the Hellboy movies has paid off and, whilst not as Del Toro-y as his previous works, his signature is clear on every single design. The robots and monsters (sorry, Jaegers and Kaiju) are all uniquely designed, taking clear influence from their forefathers but never feeling like rip-offs. The special effects are some of the best in recent memory, and there is a lot of it. Whilst practical effects are used when possible, the CG is so good that you often forget that these machines and creatures don’t exist. The cinematography and editing, whilst occasionally being a little too close for comfort, do a good job of letting the action flow and it is always clear what is going on. Top it all off with great sound design and a riveting score from Ramin Djawadi, and that is what you call technical excellence.

Pacific Rim is what every summer blockbuster should be: loud, ridiculous fun, but with thought and effort behind all the special effects. Following in suit of last year’s The Avengers, this is a film that takes its ridiculous premise and runs with it to great effect. Other than some occasionally janky storytelling and structure (seriously, the government thinks the best idea is to shut down the giant robots that have mostly been effective against the threat and quickly set up a flimsy, unreliable wall?), this is the kind of movie Hollywood should be making. Now we just have to hope it makes enough money for the studios to pay attention. God help us all if Grown Ups 2 manages to beat this at the US box office.",OFZ_Doc1_PACIFICRIM,OFZ,Sci_Fi,Positive,Pacific_Rim
241,OFZ_Doc2_PACIFICRIM,"Remember when you were a kid and you would sit around playing with whatever toys you had, and then at some point you would take two randomly different types of toys and pit them against each other in a 10 year-old’s version of the ultimate death battle?  Then you would run and tell your mom how this would make the greatest movie ever, and she laughed at you? Well, Guillermo del Toro’s mom didn’t laugh.

Pacific Rim is, in no short measure, that little kid’s wet dream. The film opens with the ‘Explain Everything Dramatically’ opening narration that is typical of movies of this ilk. Deep on the Pacific Ocean floor, a wormhole has opened and released monsters, explained as Kaiju, unto our world…the kind Godzilla would worry about.

After countless defeats, the human world bonded together to create the Jaeger Program – Jaeger meaning ‘hunter’ in German. Jaegers are giant mechanical robots designed to face off and drive back the Kaiju. They are guided by 2 pilots, 2 people who have to each share one side of the Jaeger’s ‘steering’ in a mind-melding process known as ‘Drifting’, explained as each pilot controls their side of the giant war machine.

This is where we first meet Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam), a young hotshot who co-pilots with his brother. In true Top Gun-meets-Michael Bay fashion, Raleigh’s brother is killed and Raleigh resigns from the program. From here we zip ahead 5 years to the real story, where military man Pentecoast (Elba) has one last shot to take the Kaiju down before their increasing numbers threaten to end our world as we know it.

He brings Raleigh back into the fold, initially reluctant but easily swayed. We also meet Mako (Kikuchi), a wannabe pilot with a mysterious past, wanting nothing more than to get her chance to pilot a Jaeger. As well as Charlie Day pops in as the one scientist who thinks he can figure out how to REALLY defeat the Kaiju…oh and don’t forget del Toro staple Ron Perlman, who drops in for a few as a Kaiju arms dealer who might hold a piece to the final puzzle.

Look, acting-wise? Hunnam has all the smile and swagger of a young Tom Cruise, but not much of the acting ability. If you have seen him as Jax Teller in Sons of Anarchy, he’s pretty much the exact same character, with a few less random shootings. Charlie Day plays Charlie Day, he’s the humor and he does deliver a few humorous scenes. I actually was quite taken with Mako, she did a fairly admirable job with a fairly thankless role.

The only true ‘Hell YES!’ acting in the film was Idris Elba. Even in a film that is made to make geeks across the world squee with joy but requires no real acting caliber, this guy brings his A-game. The military man with a hidden heart is a film cliché for end times, but Elba makes it play. Someone give this man a franchise of his own stat!

Ok, allllll of that to get to the heart of this flick – Does Pacific Rim make for an entertaining monster vs. robots nerdgasm? The answer is hell yes! For all of the clumsy dialogue, cheesy acting and Sci-Fi film rip-of…I mean Homage’s, Pacific Rim knows what it wants to be and that is to be a 10 year-old geek’s GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!

Let me reiterate, this isn’t the greatest movie ever made, not by a longshot. But it does bring to life a world that is a perfect meld of Anime, Godzilla, Transformers and Alien Invasion Disaster film one could ever dream up. The special effects are phenomenal, the length is perfect and the Jaeger vs. Kaiju fights do what they should – continue to escalate and cause massive worldwide destruction! This movie is made to entertain, and it does.

With this film, del Toro has proven he has what it takes to compete in a world full of Blockbuster directors and he knows how to entertain. Pacific Rim is the kind of movie that BEGS to be seen in a theater, an IMAX in particular, with the best sound system available. This is a summer blockbuster with a few flaws, but more than enough in entertainment.

The 10 year-old inside this reviewer can finally smile and put his toys away, they have finally become reality.

242,OFZ_Doc3_PACIFICRIM,"In a summer of sequels, reboots, and misfires, Pacific Rim is a brilliant surprise. Its cheerful audaciousness will take you back to a time when blockbusters were original stories that filled you with glee and wonder. This movie works just like a fairy tale, but one whose inevitable moral won't make you claw your face off.
Director Guillermo Del Toro is not one for wasting time, and nothing about Pacific Rim ever feels like padding or useless infodumpery. We begin literally in the middle of the action, as an undersea volcano in the Pacific Ocean begins belching out giant monsters. First they attack San Francisco (at this point the two six-year-old boys sitting next to me in the theater fled in terror with their mother), then Manila, then countless other cities on the Pacific coasts. Despite their obvious similarities to the rubbery kaiju of Godzilla movies, these massive creatures feel genuinely scary. As ever, Del Toro has crafted monsters that hover disturbingly between toylike and horrific.
To combat the kaiju, the world's nations pool their resources to create the jaeger program. Jaegers are giant robots that are controlled by the human mind — much the way today's bionic limbs are controlled by thought. Because they are so huge, however, the jaegers must have at least two humans at the helm, their minds networked via a technology that these robot pilots call ""the drift."" Our hero is one of these pilots, Raleigh, who goes into the drift with his brother to animate the fantastic fighting machine known as Gypsy Danger.
There is nothing more magnificent than jaegers punching out kaiju. As Del Toro has said in interviews, this movie is as much an hommage to Mexican wrestling as it is to Japanese kaiju movies. And in every fight scene, you can see the luchador moves. You probably won't be able to make it through an entire jaeger vs. kaiju fight scene without growing a goofy grin on your face and pumping your fist in the air. This is pure summer candy action, but the visuals are so crisp and stunning that it's like that one roller coaster ride at the amusement park that is actually, barftastically great.
What elevates this movie above your typical giant monster smackdown is that you actually care about the characters. When the kaiju start getting bigger, the world's governments pull out of the jaeger program and put their money into building a seawall instead. So we actually get to know the few remaining jaeger pilots, huddled in the Shatterdome robot hangar, trying to save the world with scarce resources and very little time. And of course there are two adorable scientists, one of whom has clearly been directed to act just like JJ Abrams (no really — it's kind of weird).
The idea of the drift also helps pack an emotional punch into the action. Each time pilots sync up, their minds share memories. In this way, we come to understand Raleigh's greatest trauma, which was losing his brother; and we take a deep dive into his new partner Mako's (Rinko Kikuchi) dark memories of losing her parents in a kaiju attack. Mako's adoptive father Stacker (played by the awesomely stern Idris Elba) helps provide the emotional heart of the movie, as his relationship with Mako is on the line in the final stand against the kaiju.
There are shades of Armageddon here, with daddy issues and giant explosives at the end of the world, but the difference is stark. Instead of telling a stock story about manhood, Pacific Rim complicates this basic tale by giving us a strong female lead who has to carry the day alongside all the broken and emotionally scarred men around her. The result is that this movie really feels like it's about humanity — men and women, citizens of all the nations that ring the Pacific — fighting back against a global threat to our species. There is no undercurrent of American patriotism, the way you get in Transformers or Independence Day. It's just humans against monsters. No nation or group can do it alone.
This is where Pacific Rim becomes a fairy tale for the global age. Like many fairy tales, it has a simple message about cooperating to fend off danger. But it's also clearly intended as an allegory for the kinds of problems that humanity is dealing with in the twenty-first century, specifically climate change and natural disasters that transcend national boundaries. There is some hilariously bad jibber-jabber about how environmental destruction brought the monsters, but that simply underscores my point about how Pacific Rim is really about something more allegorical than ocean acidification.
It's about how our problems are no longer the purview of one nation anymore. To meet the world's new dangers, we need to stop identifying as Americans or Chinese or Russians — we need to identify as humans. That's why the movie is called Pacific Rim. It's about viewing our homes in terms of the planet's geological features, instead of political creations.
Look, I'm not saying that this movie beats you over the head with a ""we are the world"" message. Far from it. Mostly it just mashes you in the eyes with mega-fights and crazy schemes to plant nukes inside the throat of another dimension. But what makes it a truly great fairy tale, instead of just another CGI clunker, is the humble truth at the heart of this simple story. We are all in this together. So let's go kick some kaiju ass!

243,OFZ_Doc4_PACIFICRIM,"Despite being a big, blustery blockbuster, Pacific Rim may work best in its smaller moments, a testament to director Guillermo del Toro’s ability to build worlds.
Yes, there are giant monsters fighting giant robots. And yes, they’re pretty cool looking and fun and fantastic. But the little touches added by del Toro are what bring this universe to life.
Set 12 years in the future, the world of Pacific Rim has been ravaged by kaiju (Japanese for giant monster) attacks for more than a decade. The robotic Jaegers (German for hunter) that defend the planet aren’t shiny and new but are dinged up; the suits their pilots wear are scuffed. Like Ridley Scott’s Alien or Blade Runner, this is a future that feels lived in.
Hong Kong, the site of an attack, has been rebuilt around a giant carcass—a kaiju skull serves as a church. A black market in kaiju organs has sprung up, one of the few booming sectors in the global economy. Fiscal collapse is imminent as the world evacuates its coastlines and resources are poured into military programs designed to stop the seemingly endless wave of monster attacks.
The destruction of numerous Jaegers in battle with increasingly sophisticated monsters prompts the world’s governments to build walls around coastal nations in order to keep the rampaging monsters out. But the plan is doomed to fail. The leader of the giant robots, Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), has planned one last mission to seal the underwater breach from which the monsters enter our world.
To accomplish his goal, he needs Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), an ace Jaeger pilot whose copilot (and brother) is killed in the film’s opening battle. Raleigh was traumatized by his brother’s death, which he felt firsthand, as the ""mental load"" required to pilot a Jaeger requires two fighter jocks to engage in a sort of mind-meld that allows them to operate, and fight, in sync. Raleigh finds a new copilot, and a kindred spirit, in Mako (Rinko Kikuchi).
Providing comic relief are a pair of scientists: mathematician Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) and alien biologist/""kaiju groupie"" Newton (Charlie Day). Their bickering, and Newton’s dealings with black market hustler Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman), inject a dose of levity into the proceedings and help remind us that, yes, we are watching an utterly ridiculous—and ridiculously fun—movie.
As for the main attraction—the extended battles between mecha-warriors and extra-dimensional monsters—well, what is there to critique? You’re either going to enjoy watching several-hundred-feet tall robots use giant shipping tankers as Kendo sticks against several-hundred-feet tall monsters who spit acid and emit EMPs, or you aren’t. I enjoyed the sequences a great deal, as did the audience with which I saw Pacific Rim. But you can probably tell from the advertisements whether or not this is a film for you.
There are things to quibble about with the script. Internal inconsistencies plague the picture. For instance: Newton informs the audience that the monsters are clones and bred to be killing machines. However, we later find out that one of the kaiju is pregnant, leading to an amusing and imaginative sequence with a baby kaiju that looks kind of cool but totally negates the previous plot point. Unless, of course, life found a way.
This may seem nitpicky, but suspension of disbelief only works as long as the universe in which we are being asked to believe operates in a steady manner. When you start introducing noticeable irregularities into the proceedings you take the audience out of the picture.

244,OFZ_Doc5_PACIFICRIM,"Brace yourself, otaku boys across the globe, Guillermo Del Toro's Pacific Rim is the most expensive B-movie ever! And that's a big, big compliment in the season of sterile blockbusters, for this is an immensely imaginative, wildly exhilarating ride through kaiju geekery, Godzilla roars, apocalyptic frenzy and robot fetishism. In short, an East Asian monster flick begotten from the unlikely womb of a Mexican director by way of Hollywood surrogates. Move over Marvel heroes and Superbore, Pacific Rim is the most shamelessly entertaining summer movie we've seen so far this year.
Of course I'm speaking from the perspective of a generation that grew up watching Godzilla flicks and Japanese monster TV movies _ those low-tech apocalyptic flicks full of hyperbole from the hi-tech nation that knows a few things about annihilation (or being annihilated). Some early reviews from US-based reviewers call Pacific Rim ""derivative"", which is completely missing the point, because the film wants to be derivative, it has to be derivative _ a proud derivative of a cinematic tradition from this side of the world (Pacific side, indeed) that once thrived on monstrous obsession and otherworldly horror. It is also a cinematic tradition that pins the survival of mankind on the help of man-made machines and gigantic automatons, and this is what Del Toro embraces and expands with a crazy mixture of childlike glee and professional mania.
The satisfaction is in how Del Toro combines sophisticated computer imagery _ a now-standard practice in Hollywood sci-fi _ with pre-digital special effects, cruder around the edges and yet highly effective in the combat scenes. His sense of story also has that barefaced naivete of a matinee cartoon: in the near future, the planet is attacked by a successive wave of kaiju _ monsters in Japanese _ which warp themselves from another dimension to a crack in the Pacific Ocean. These aliens _ leathery, acidic, colonial-minded _ have flattened cities along Pacific coasts, and humans have united to fight them by inventing Jaeger, a fleet of gargantuan robots of various nationalities (a three-limbed Chinese make, for instance, and a Stalinist monolith from the Russians). Each Jaeger is controlled by the neuro signals of two pilots, who have to work together in a telepathic ""drift"" which syncs their movements with that of the colossal machine.
Charlie Hunnam, Rinko Kikuchi and Idris Elba, to name just a few, are among the last batch of Jaeger pilots, each with their own emotional baggage caused by the ruthless, increasingly reprehensible kaiju. The massive death-matches between the Jaegers and the monsters take place mostly in the ocean _ off the Alaskan coast, in Hong Kong Harbour, and down in the depths of the Pacific. But the central set piece in the city of Hong Kong, where the entire metropolis becomes a gladiatorial ring of two beasts, is one of the most sensational and transfixing in recent memory. That's also a scene where the Godzilla aesthetics and almost home-made special effects prove their merit in the age of digital dominance. Don't be fooled into thinking that this is another dumb robo-brawl like Transformers, which is hideously militaristic and cluttered, or the child's play of Real Steel, which not many people even remember now. What makes Pacific Rim tick is Del Toro's precise visuals and his skilful choreography of the diverse elements in the frame. Even in the tumult of the combat, we know what's going on in each successive shot _ it's the rhythm that propels the film and keeps it steady even during the insanely fast action. Talking about the combat: Fans of Japanese monster series will also be surprised at how the Mexican director's is so well-versed in the visual vocabulary of the genre. Pacific Rim quotes a number of familiar shots and ""gestures"" young boys saw on late-morning Thai TV 30 years ago _ especially a selection of signature coups de grace when the heroic robot deals fatal blows to the monsters. My only guess is that the cinephilic riches has certainly spread across the Pacific from Japan to Central America.
What Del Toro has done here reminds us about what Quentin Tarantino did in Kill Bill: a Western homage and internationalising of the Asian cinematic memory (which always has an inherent ""B-movie"" quality to non-Asian viewers). Tarantino is a fanboy/intellectual, and his appropriation of another movie tradition, while immensely physical, involves a lot of mind work. Del Toro, schooled in schlock horror and Third-World sensationalism, aims for surface fun and and announces himself into the league of boy-men who know how to preserve a boy's exuberance and develop a man's gift to turn toys into weapons, and memory into action.",OFZ_Doc5_PACIFICRIM,OFZ,Sci_Fi,Positive,Pacific_Rim
245,OFZ_Doc6_PACIFICRIM,"Teamwork saves the world in Guillermo del Toro’s big-budget monster movie Pacific Rim. It’s a sentiment both profound and clichéd, but underneath the industrial firepower of the iron giants that battle sea monsters is a genuine human element.
At least, that’s the theory. This blockbuster provides plenty of spectacle, but the characters who inhabit it are, despite their Shakespearean airs, not vivid enough for you to care beyond the wow factor.
But there is a wow factor. In a near future curiously outfitted with analog flip-number clocks, gigantic monsters called Kaiju threaten the world, alien sea creatures that have arrived not from space but from deep underneath the Earth’s surface.
This will sound familiar to fans of Japanese monster movies. Godzilla, the ur-Kaiju, emerged from a country still reeling from Hiroshima. The 1954 Japanese film, before producers dubbed voices and added Raymond Burr for American audiences, was a stark vision of hopelessness and apocalyptic anxiety. The movie spawned dozens of low-budget monster movies with cheesy effects and gravitas (think of the descending line from Jaws to Sharknado), even inspiring a dance craze.
There is no dancing in Del Toro’s big-budget monster movie. Pacific Rim taps on the kind of anxiety that gave birth to Godzilla: we are our own enemy, founts of monstrous energy that surfaces as colossal parasites destroying the planet from within. The Kaiju multiply and these negative energies, distortions of Mother Nature, leave civilization in near ruins.
Technology—not just technology, but mega-technology—comes to the rescue in the form of giant robots called Jaegers. The mechanics seem silly, like a Nintendo Wii writ large. Early trials had a single pilot maneuvering the massive animatronic puppet. These pioneers returned shaken, with nosebleeds hinting at even greater the inner damage. Then came the two-pilot system, but there’s a hitch. For two people to command this single monstrous structure, they must be “drift-compatible,” mind melding in a way that respected both pilots’ experiences, but coming together as a unit more powerful than its separate parts.
It’s a touching metaphor for human connection, not simply in a romantic sense (the cursory love story is unconvincing even for a summer blockbuster) but as brother-to-brother or father to son. Pacific Rim‘s battles are set in a roiling sea where the dark spray and shifting horizon disorient the viewer in much the way that the GoPro footage in the seafaring documentary Leviathan throws the viewer completely off balance. This is the stage on which humans try to relate to each other and work towards a common goal. It’s hard as hell, but the reward can be like saving the world.
Idris Elba plays Stacker Pentecost, a loaded name if there ever was one. If his name suggests a religious fervor, his dialogue often recalls Henry V, and given that the end of the world is played out in the breech between the deep sea Kaiju and the earth’s surface, I’m glad the screenwriters (del Toro and Travis Beacham) didn’t make Elba order his charges once more unto it.
Elba has gravitas, but I don’t see the passion, and I imagined what Andre Braugher could have made out of this role. But he’s not the problem. Charlie Hunnam plays hero Raleigh Becket, and his voice grates, reminding me at times of a cartoon character’s. His nemesis Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky) looks enough like Hunnam that I did not always know who was who. Is this a deliberate show of the battles we have with ourselves? Mako (Rinko Kikuchi, last seen on American screens in an adaptation of Haruki Murakami’s Norwegian Wood) has a great back-story, but she is supposed to have chemistry with Hunnam, and there isn’t any. If this were an actual Kaiju emergency, the two actors would steer their Jaeger straight into the sea.
Pacific Rim is an effectively loud spectacle, as simple as monsters vs. monsters saving the world. I wish the characters that populated it had the depth to pull all the human resonance out of that potentially powerful setup.",OFZ_Doc6_PACIFICRIM,OFZ,Sci_Fi,Negative,Pacific_Rim

""Pacific Rim"" is a great, lumbering ox of a movie, possibly the single loudest film I have ever attended. It may feel simplistic to call this movie ""Godzilla vs. the Transformers,"" but that's about all you need to know.

""Pacific Rim"" is set far into the future, several years after massive lizards called Kaiju started crawling up out of the Pacific Ocean and attacking Earth's cities. Humanity responded by building 10-story robots called Jaegers that would get in fist fights with them whenever they'd get too close to shore. ""Fighting monsters with monsters"" is the way they put it, I think.
Initially the invaders only came one at a time. But as ""Pacific Rim"" opens, fast-talking, highly-agitated scientists have discovered that the planet is on the verge of a major dinosaur invasion, and so the Jaegers are rallied to make humanity's last stand. Most of the characters involved are little more than cannon fodder, except for Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket (played by Charlie Hunnam), who lost his brother to one of the Kaiju and now has issues with authority.
If you can accept this, awesome. Have fun, and enjoy your reinforced bass. And to be fair, the 3-D isn’t too bad.
But if your brain starts asking questions, watch out. Don't let it ask you why the best response to the threat was to build slow-moving robots instead of, say, better long-range bombs. And definitely don't let your brain ask you why they put the pilots inside the robots instead of operating them remotely. Maybe the wireless programs of the future are just as overpriced as they are today?
It's tempting to dismiss ""Pacific Rim's"" excesses by claiming ""summer blockbusters are supposed to be big and dumb and loud,"" but the film shows enough flashes of potential (such as the “neural handshake” pilots use to operate the Jaegers) that I was left wishing director Guillermo del Toro had given us a little more here. Or at least forced his actors to enunciate all their dialogue. The advent of the Kaiju Era must have had a traumatic effect on humanity, because most everyone in ""Pacific Rim"" spits out their lines in such a hasty fashion that they must be expecting death at any moment.
It's possible the film has a very good plot, but with so much of the dialogue lost in erratic delivery or under the weight of the bass-rumbling soundtrack, we’ll never really know for sure. Maybe the DVD subtitles will help.
Still, if you have to lump ""Pacific Rim"" into the overblown CGI genre with the ""Transformers"" franchise, you must admit del Toro's film offers a couple improvements over Michael Bay's trilogy. First of all, the overbearing volume is in the lower register, so you won't leave the theater with a headache. Second, since the good guys are robots and the bad guys are dinosaurs, it's a lot easier to tell who you're supposed to be cheering for during the extended battle sequences.
As a tribute to the Godzilla/King Kong genre, “Pacific Rim” isn’t too bad. But after seeing the “Jurassic Park” re-release a few months back, it is hard not to be reminded of what a summer blockbuster should be.
""Pacific Rim"" is rated PG-13 for continual CGI action violence, some gross-out Kaiju gore and sporadic profanity. While it's thin on content that would be considered offensive, it's not a movie for small children. A couple sitting in front of me brought an infant to the IMAX press screening. The kid lasted about 15 minutes.

247,OFZ_Doc8_PACIFICRIM,"This is one of those reviews where I know I’m in the minority and I know everyone will disagree but I’m going to give my honest review and let the chips fall where they may. I didn’t love Pacific Rim. I went in fully expecting to—wanting to—but I didn’t, couldn’t love it. This isn’t to say I hated it. I didn’t hate it. It’s not the dumbest movie I’ve seen this summer (White House Down), or the worst (The Lone Ranger). It just wasn’t nearly good as expected, and had one of the most predictable screenplays I’ve seen in a long time. Maybe ever.
I’m not holding being a dumb movie against Pacific Rim. I never thought it would be anything but dumb. I thought it would be director Guillermo del Toro’s take on a dumb movie, which is to say silly, yes, maybe even stupid, but engrossing and strange and entertaining like any del Toro movie. But it’s too stupid to buy into, and worse, it’s lazy. Del Toro clearly has a great love for the classic kaiju movies like Godzilla and Mothra, and he lovingly rendered every monster and robot with incredible detail—this is some of the most spectacular CGI you’ll see anywhere. But I wish he’d invested even a fraction of that care in just one character. I just needed one thing to care about in Pacific Rim but there was nothing.
We’re supposed to care about Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam, Sons of Anarchy), a character so cartoonishly derivative he might as well have been named Hero McMaverick (that name would totally have fit in the Pacific Rim universe).
Everything about Raleigh is short hand for “hero”. He’s blonde, he’s hot, he walks tough and flares his nostrils. He says things like, “I’m not that guy anymore,” and, “Out there, it’s not a simulation.” He’s surrounded by people like Herc Hansen (Max Martini, Revenge), a world-weary father who can’t connect with his asshole son (Robert Kazinsky, True Blood), who in turn butts heads with Raleigh because duh. And don’t get me started on Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi, Babel), the fetishized Asian chick in love with the white hero because DUH. (Although I did appreciate that they didn’t throw a titsy blonde at Raleigh, so I guess that’s a wash.)
None of this is the actors’ fault. They all do what they can with what they’ve got, which is practically nothing, but the acting is not a problem in Pacific Rim. It is, however, a problem that such a great group of actors is so wholly underserved. Poor Idris Elba—whose real-life name would have worked just as well as “Stacker Pentecost”—is relegated to pacing around and barking orders like “stay back!” and “hold the line!” only to be completely disregarded at every turn. I just can’t ignore that none of these people played an actual character. I can’t ding World War Z for lacking proper characters and then give Pacific Rim a pass because I wanted to like it more.
It’s just so predictable. It’s not a little bit predictable, or even familiar like a loving homage—Pacific Rim is, at every stage, entirely predictable like del Toro was working down a checklist of action movie tropes. At one point a particular kaiju appeared and I thought, “They’re going to pull that one apart by its jaws,” and then yep, that’s exactly what happened. That kaiju existed simply to be pulled apart by its jaws.
And therein is Pacific Rim’s biggest problem—things just exist. There’s never any reason given, and there’s no logical limit on what can be done. Fighting a kaiju and need a sword? Boom—your jaeger has a sword. Of course! Of course it does! People, monsters, swords—things just materialize because reasons, and nothing is ever accounted for. In the opening scene Raleigh’s half of the jaeger—oh yeah, it takes two people to pilot a jaeger because C’MON GUYS, IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE—is badly damaged and he is obviously injured via…I dunno, bio-feedback?…and he later mentions his arm is weak because of that incident, except he never acts like it. We see Raleigh brawling, we see him fighting with martial arts, but he never compensates like his arm is a weakness. Until, that is, he climbs back inside a jaeger and it’s convenient to say, “I’m taking this side, my arm is kind of shot.” And when Mako suffers the exact same injury that hurt Raleigh in the opening, she goes on like it’s nothing. There is zero reaction. There’s no consistency because stuff is just happening whenever it’s convenient or would look coolest with no regard to logic or character.
Raleigh Becket. Stacker Pentecost. Herc Hansen. Mako Mori. Hannibal Chau. Newt. Everyone in Pacific Rim had a batsh*t name created by a twelve-year-old playing Call of Duty. And that was actually okay. It became endearing after a while, this parade of insanely named non-people. The one that drove me nuts, though, was “Gipsy Danger”, Raleigh’s jaeger. All the jaegers had names but only Gipsy Danger registered. Why was it spelled like that?! Why GIP-sy?! That drove me crazy. And that pretty much sums up Pacific Rim. The movie was so predictable I could spend all my time wondering about a typo instead of being concerned for the heroes because the ending was never in question. Just the number of robot swords was.",OFZ_Doc8_PACIFICRIM,OFZ,Sci_Fi,Negative,Pacific_Rim
248,OFZ_Doc9_PACIFICRIM,"Expectation can be a terrible drug to come down from. With only the tiniest bits of information and foreknowledge, one can allow oneself to be intoxicated on the rush of expectation that comes from approaching a new film, especially one with a dynamite premise from a beloved filmmaker. The rush of the anticipation leading up to those first frames, and the seemingly fulfilling opening moments to follow, can bring an audience member a kind of moment immeasurable joy, creating a wave of euphoria that crests, breaks, and then rolls back the longer the film goes on, leaving behind only the flinty bedrock of a single thought: This is all there is.
This may seem an odd complaint to level against a film such as Pacific Rim. After all, the trailers and marketing for this film promised two things – monsters and robots, and the epic battle between the two – and in that literal sense the film delivers. During the course of two hours there are indeed giant monsters, and giant robots, and we do get to see them engaged in city-flattening brawls. So what is the problem? Why, if this film gave me the only two things it told me I would get, did I feel so deflated and underwhelmed and disappointed?
Because Pacific Rim could have done more. It may not seem fair of me to allow my hopes for what could have been to so greatly affect my estimation of what is, but look at what raw materials we had to work with. The plot alone is enough to get one’s inner six-year-old positively rabid with excitement.
Years after the first of the Kaiju – building-sized inter-dimensional monsters – broke through a rift at the bottom of the ocean, mankind has turned the killing of the monsters into a propaganda stunt thanks to the creation of the Jaegers, impossibly large robots so complex they have to be controlled by two pilots in a “neural bridge” that lets them share memories and thoughts. Pilots became rock stars, Kaiju became curiosities, and all seemed well. Now, though, the Kaiju are becoming more resilient, their appearances more frequent, and their threat much larger.
At the behest of Commander Pentecost (Idris Elba), disgraced Jaeger pilot Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) must join a coalition of the remaining Jaeger pilots for one last bold assault on the source of the Kaiju threat, while at the same time navigating his own troubled past, and forging a bond with his new co-pilot, Mako (Rinku Kikuchi).
A mid-summer action film with this premise, bursting with entertaining and capable character actors, ramped up with big-budget special effects, and helmed by one of the most inventive and heartfelt genre directors currently working (Guillermo del Toro) should be a home run. It should have been big, it should have been bold, it should have been special. It should have been more than the dull, faint, repeating echo of its premise.
Blame the genesis of my disappointment on Guillermo del Toro. From his intimate work in Pan’s Labyrinth to his bombastic romp through Hellboy to his mastery of dread-filled tone in Mimic, del Toro has proven that he not only has an eye for stunning visuals in terms of creature design and composition, but that he is also able to keep a firm handle on the human core of even his nonhuman characters. Yet the characters in this film are stock and static, seemingly born with substandard action film clichés coded into their DNA.
These characters begin on a note, and continue to pound that note in the slight hope that their monotone could be mistaken for character consistency. Their place in the narrative is delineated in bold exposition delivered in staggeringly firm declarative sentences that echo in the metal-hulled halls of various factories and hangars. The rival openly states his disdain for the hero; the hero openly states his affection for the girl; the lab techs bicker over who is more adept at predicting the peril about to befall the world; et cetera. They feel things we are given no baseline to expect, but helpfully say their feelings aloud. They do things seemingly on a whim, and then helpfully explain not only their purpose in doing these things, but the outcome of the thing they did.
In the world of Pacific Rim, explanation takes the place of reason.
Maybe none of this would truly matter if the film didn’t spend so much time trying to convince the audience that these were people worth caring about. Raleigh and Mako talk openly about their special connection, but they do so almost immediately, giving us no time to see it before we are told to expect it. Elba’s Pentecost is a fun throwback to the no-nonsense leaders of old, but he only seems to want to obfuscate his past so that he can reveal it at the most dramatically relevant time.
All of this stagnant character work could be forgiven if the promised fights had any kind of dynamism or intelligence to them, but they don’t. There is never any sense of the flow of the battle, of the tide turning, of the opponents engaging in a dance of death that will leave one of them felled. They are just two dumb foes brutally pummeling one another until the plot dictates that one of them die, at which point one of them does. The bulk of the full-length battles we see occur in close up, shot in darkness, often in the rain or in hip-deep water. This robs the film of any sense of scale or magnitude, sapping the awe and wonder out of what should be a euphoric, otherworldly experience.
There is no joy in having to level these criticisms against a movie like Pacific Rim, a film I was eagerly anticipating despite my lackluster response to all but the most recent marketing materials. I expected the one of a kind wonder that del Toro so often delivers on the screen, combined with the scale and visceral thrill that the plot could provide. I expected the melding of horror and humor so singular to him, not the soulless and ultimately monotonous spectacle actually delivered.
As I said, expectation can be a terrible drug to come down from, and so to anyone who might still be thinking of courting Pacific Rim, all I can say is this – keep those expectations low, or the crash is going to hurt more than the meager rush can assuage.

249,OFZ_Doc10_PACIFICRIM,"The positive buzz “Pacific Rim” cultivated prior to release shouldn’t surprise anyone. Writer-director Guillermo del Toro (“Hellboy,” “Pan’s Labyrinth”) is a beloved figure amongst much of the filmgoing community, and the picture’s shameless approach to pre-adolescent wish fulfillment seems to have struck a chord with that same crowd. In fact, just the idea of a big-budget robot versus monster movie seemed to be enough to win over many pundits, and many were carrying the film’s water on principle alone. How wrong could an intrinsically talented filmmaker go in pitting man-made robots against a race of otherworldly monsters? In two words? Very wrong.
“Pacific Rim” is stupid. All-caps stupid. So stupid that it willfully evokes Roland Emmerich’s much-maligned “Godzilla” remake (translation: overblown special effects combined with base monster movie tropes), along with countless other lumbering summer tentpoles, the best of which are nothing more than guilty pleasures (e.g. “Independence Day,” another Roland Emmerich joint). All that matters here is destruction, and the audience’s willingness to forgive the film for being so terrible in all other respects. Tonally, “Pacific Rim” puts the “disaster” in “disaster movie.”
Charlie Hunnam, with all the charisma of a limestone wall, stars as Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger (giant robot) pilot in the fight against the Kaiju (giant monsters). Del Toro makes the insane decision to skip over the Kaiju’s origins via montage, leaving any hint of mystery out of the equation. In fact, we’re treated to a full-scale fight sequence before the opening titles. Thusly, what we know about or see of the Kaiju barely changes over the course of the next 2 hours, making it even more miraculous that Charlie Day is able to steal the show as Dr. Newton Geiszler, a scientist-slash-Kaiju-enthusiast – more on him later.
Also along for the ride: Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost, the comically stoic Jaeger commander, Rinko Kikuchi as Mako, Raleigh’s combat partner and half-baked love interest, and Ron Perlman as Hannibal Chau, a mythical gangster who makes a living on the black market by harvesting and selling Kaiju organs. The entire cast seems to be unsure as to what kind of movie they’re in, but it’s hard to assign blame because the pic’s various subplots are startlingly disjointed. Half of the film is played deadly serious, while the other half swerves back and forth between camp and broad comedy. Clifton Collins Jr., an undeniably talented character actor, turns in one of the year’s worst performances as a laughably over-eager Jaeger technician. But it’s impossible to say where the character went wrong – whether it was in the writing process, in del Toro’s direction, or in Collins’ choices on-set.
The aforementioned Charlie Day, accompanied by a rival scientist played by Burn Gorman (who acts as though he’s in a real world episode of “Scooby Doo”), gets nearly all of the film’s best moments, sharing much of his screen time with the always watchable Perlman. As the monsters are naturally more interesting than their mechanical adversaries, Day’s character is our much-needed portal into the world of the Kaiju, and his dexterous performance – along with the few glimpses we get of the monsters in broad daylight – are highlights.
If you’re only concerned with the action scenes, they’re fine, if not exactly revolutionary. The onslaught of CGI, while very well done, is just as exhausting as it was in Michael Bay’s “Transformers” films, except here there’s even more of it. Entire scenes are comprised entirely of special effects with no sense of gravity to any of it. While del Toro has a better visual eye than most of his contemporaries, it’s still difficult to make sense of machines that don’t and couldn’t exist interact with monsters the size of skyscrapers. While Spielberg went to great lengths with “Jurassic Park” to maintain a sense of scale (and intrigue, and intellect, etc.), del Toro doesn’t seem to care that we believe any of what we’re seeing, because – robots and monsters!
“Pacific Rim” is yet another victim of its own hype, a bulky, balky summer actioner that demands we check our brains at the door for fear that we might recognize its flimsiness. It practically shouts its audience into compliance only to spend the following two hours celebrating itself as the ultimate realization of those rainy Saturday afternoons that many of us spent playing with action figures. Except, action figures are meant to stoke imaginations, not replace them. As well intentioned as Guillermo’s del Toro’s latest may be, it’s a lousy stand-in for actual childhood memories.

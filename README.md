# NLP_MovieReviews


Natural language processing utilizes text to create a representation or understanding of the words for computers. Because computers have no semantic understanding, the text must be processed and encoded as vectors to carry that meaning with them. The goal is to develop a corpus vocabulary that encapsulates the meaningful and important terms that would best represent the documents, so that they can be clustered with their corresponding genre and sentiment. 

The goal of this project is to process movie review text to be able to classify each review to its corresponding genre and/or sentiment. To accomplish this goal, different data wrangling methods will be experimented to see which best processes the texts for the intended purpose. Assignment 1 experiments with different vectorization methods including tf-idf, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec models. With these methods, the similarity between tokens and documents can be observed. The similarity will show if the tokens or documents are able to be clustered and classified with one another.
